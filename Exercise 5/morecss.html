  <p class="yellow rounded">The width property sets the content that the property is applied to. For example, if the width of a paragraph tag being set to 50%, the paragraph will be half of the width of the broswer page. The min-width property will override the basic width property by setting the minimum width and will ensure that the width of the content doesn't become smaller than the set value. For example, a header tag set to min-width of 50px means that it can't get smaller than 50 pixels. The max-width property is used similarly to min-width, but it prevents the width of the content from getting bigger than the set value. For example, a paragraph tag with a max width of 30% means that the paragraph won't get bigger than 30% of the page's width.</p>
  <p class="yellow shadow">The box-shadow property is used to create at least one shadow behind an element's box, though many could be added. A shadow could be faded or solid, thick or thin, based on the values set for the properties. Using multiple shadows, different colored layers could be applied, or a shadow could be used to make the box appear to be in 3D!</p>
  <p class="seethrough">The opacity property sets how solid and visible the element is. Opacity could be used to make a paragraph or image slightly less visible or almost completely invisible, based on the percentage or decimal equivalent set for the value of the property. A smaller percent or decimal makes the element more invisible and a higher percent or decimal makes the element more visible.</p>
