 <h4>2011</h4>
  <h3><a id="summary">Summary</a></h3>
  <p>A maid in a large manor house is called by her master to the basement, where he trips her down the stairs and uses a chisel to pry her teeth out, claiming that he was forced to if he wanted to see his son again. While counting the teeth, he hears his son’s voice coming from an oven. He places the teeth into the oven, begging for his son back, and a voice tells him to reach in for the son. He does so, and creatures rush out of a dark hole and pull him down. A man, Alex, is waiting at the airport with Kim, his girlfriend, for his daughter, Sally, coming in from LA. She’s very unreceptive as he takes her to their home they’re restoring, the manor from earlier. She pores through an office and Kim shows her the paintings in the house by the former owner. Alex shows her to her room and tries to explain to her that she’s going to live with him now for a “change of scenery”. That night, the voices in the oven in the basement call her name. The next day, she finds a grotto in the grounds with a pedestal made of antlers, a fairy ring of mushrooms, and a window into a basement that no one seems to know about. The groundskeeper, Harris, doesn’t want anyone to find the basement, but Alex objects and breaks down a wall to find the basement. As they explore, Harris tries to tell them it’s not safe, especially for kids, but Alex doesn’t heed him. Sally finds the oven, but it’s bolted shut. She heads back down later with tools to remove the bolts. Voices from the oven tell her to set them free. Alex finds her and she tells him about the voices, but he doesn’t hear them and takes her upstairs. The creatures finish unbolting the door and push it open, allowing Sally to look inside. She leans in and finds the teeth that had been left inside. Alex calls her again and she leaves, taking some teeth with her. She refuses to eat dinner and is sent to bed early. When she’s in her room, the creatures creep through the house, stealing keys, and try to lure Sally back into the basement by taking her doll. They tell her they’re hungry and want to be friends. She places one of the teeth under the pillow and when she wakes up, it’s replaced with a large coin. Kim finds some clothes shredded and Alex’s razor missing. Alex confronts Sally about it and she tearfully says she didn’t do it before they leave for an appointment. When she goes to the basement to ask the creatures, they try to lure her into the oven. Harris finds her and forces her upstairs while trying to put the bolts back on the door. The creatures attack him, but he drives them off with a strong flashlight and makes his way back upstairs. The housekeeper and Sally see him come up, and Sally runs outside to hide in a tree. Kim finds her when they return while Alex deals with the police and shows her a fountain in a maze in the garden and they have a bonding moment, Kim telling her that she doesn’t care about the clothes. That night, she calls her mother asking to come home, and gets blown off. She falls asleep on Kim and Alex’s bed and Kim finds her and takes her back to her room, Sally begs her to stay and she falls asleep with her. The creatures knock her lamp off her nightstand and attack her. She drives them off screaming for Alex and tries to tell him about them but he doesn’t believe her, hiring a psychologist to talk with her. He tells Alex and Kim that she’s feeling unwanted and that the creatures are in her head. Alex thinks it’s dealt with and tries to focus on the restoration of the house, but Kim doesn’t feel right. She goes to talk to Harris in the hospital, and he tells her to get Sally out of the house and to look into something at the library. While Sally is going to take a bath, the creatures are stalking her through the vents. They turn the lights off and break the lock so no one can get in to her. At the library, Kim is shown a collection of sketches by Blackwood, including several of the creatures, and is told that according to folklore, that the creatures need to take a life every time they come up to replenish their ranks. The creatures attack Kim, but are driven off by the housekeeper busting in. When Kim comes home, she tries to find Sally, but she’s left. She and Alex go after her. They come to get her, and when they get home, Kim finds the razor in her drawer and she claims she needs it to keep them away from her. Kim gives her a polaroid with a bright flash to help keep her safe. Kim sees her drawings of the creatures and starts to pack her things to get her out. Sally gets a picture of a creature and tries to show Alex while he’s having a dinner for his benefactors. He ignores it and they steal the picture. She chases them into the office and they attack her, throwing books and paintings at her while she tires to drive them away with the flash. Alex and Kim, along with the rest of the dinner party, break into the office to find her after she crushes one of the creatures, and Alex finally decides it’s time to leave. While he’s getting the car ready to go, the creatures attack him and cut the power to the house. While Kim’s trying to find out what’s happening, they trip her down the stairs and attack her, demanding Sally. Sally wakes up and finds Kim passed out on the floor. The creatures surround her and drag her into the basement. Kim and Alex both wake up and hear Sally screaming. When Alex tries to break out of the garage, they attack him again, trying to keep him in. Kim finds them trying to pull Sally into the pit with rope. Kim tries to stop them but there are too many of them. Kim cuts the rope, allowing Sally to escape, but she gets pulled into the pit instead. Alex comes down to see Kim get pulled down. Months later, Alex and Sally return to the house to say their final goodbyes and Sally leaves Kim a picture. The basement door opens and pulls the drawing down and through the grate into the oven. The creatures below worry if more will come to fight them, but Kim’s voice echoes out that they will soon forget and others will come in time.</p>
  <h3><a id="thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <p>This movie was far better than I thought it was going to be. It could have been better. There were too many zoom in shots that always sucks, and some of the writing was cliché and predictable, but there were some great character arcs and pretty good CGI for the year it was made in. There was plenty of tension, as I wasn’t sure if the parents would listen to Sally or not, and some drama involving the parents’ decision about Sally, and all of it felt earned and necessary. The horror came from not from the creatures, which were small, but from the vast multitude of them. The pacing was good and nothing felt too long or short. Nothing any character did felt out of character or out of place. I was afraid Alex would never believe, but he flipped right around after she was attacked in the office and did the right thing by her. The acting was spectacular, particularly by Kim, played by <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005017/">Katie Holmes</a>, and Sally. That little girl knocked it out of the park. The story was phenomenal, original and chilling, and the ending was incredibly chilling. I like to see more stories with the Fae as the antagonists, because in folklore and myths, they were monsters, and I appreciate Del Toro’s attempt at shedding a light on them. I will always be a fan of that man’s work, and I know I have at least <a href="antlers.html">one more movie</a> by him on this list. </p>
