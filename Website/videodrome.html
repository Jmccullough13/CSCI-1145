 <h4>1983</h4>
  <h3><a id="summary">Summary</a></h3>
  <p>A woman, Bridey, comes on a TV to provide Max a wakeup call and a reminder of the days’ events. He has a meeting with a Japanese client about the purchase of Japanese porn movies for the channel he works for. He discusses the videos with his coworkers and says he’s looking for something that will shock their audiences. He speaks with Harlan, a video pirate, about trying to unscramble a broadcast they had found showing a woman being tormented by men in aprons against a clay wall background. Harlan promises to try and find more video from the source. Max has an interview with a talk show host about the content of his channel and its impact and tries to defend it against Nicki, a radio help show host. He meets with Harlan again after he finds an hour long transmission of people being tortured, with Max commenting on how real the footage is. Harlan mentions that it comes from Pittsburgh. On a date with Nicki at home, she finds the tapes of the transmission, labelled as Videodrome, and it leads to a romantic interlude, where Max fantasizes that they’re on the location of Videodrome. He has a meeting with Masha, an agent, who brings him material to try and sell. He tells her about Videodrome and asks her to try and hunt it down. Nicki tells Max that she’s going to Pittsburgh to try and audition for Videodrome, but Max warns her against it. He meets with Masha after she’s gotten in touch with the people who make Videodrome and ands she warns him to forget it, that the shows isn’t acting, but real. She gets Max in touch with someone involved with the show named Brian O’blivion. He goes to Pittsburgh to meet with O’blivion, who runs a “soup kitchen” style place that allows homeless people access to a TV to help ease their withdrawal from TV, but meets with his daughter Bianca instead, who tells him he needs to pitch a reason to her to speak with her father. He mentions Videodrome and leaves. Bridey, his secretary, comes over to give him his wake up video and a video delivery and when she goes to take the Videodrome tape from his VCR, he slaps her, sees her as Nicki and slaps her again, and takes the tape. He apologizes, but she says he didn’t hit her. The delivery is from O’blivion, and when he takes it out, it bulges out. When he plays it, O’blivion comes on screen saying how what people see on screen will become reality, that Max is having hallucinations, to be careful that the hallucinations don’t take over his life, and that Videodrome was the result of his own hallucinations, taking form. He’s strapped to a chair and choked with a wire, and his attacker is revealed to look like Nicki, who talks to him through the TV. His TV begins to bulge and pulse as Nicki moans on the TV. The screen bulges out and he shoves his face into it. He goes to talk to Bianca again and she tells him that the Videodrome signal causes the hallucinations and causes a tumor. She reveals that Brian has been dead for months, caused by Videodrome, which he helped to create. She gives him tapes from her father to help him. The tapes tell him that Brian thought that the tumor wasn’t a tumor but a new growth of the brain, a new organ. A hole opens in Max’s abdomen and he sticks a gun in it before it closes up, thinking it a hallucination, but afterward, he can’t find the gun. Barry Convex, one of Videodrome’s creators, gets in touch with Max and tells him that Videodrome wasn’t ready, that what Max saw were test signals, and that none of the test subjects has been able to return to normal life and are all under psychiatric care. He puts a machine on Max’s head to record one of hic hallucinations to try and find out why he hasn’t succumbed to the hallucinations yet. Nicki comes up to him and hands him a whip. They’re in the videodrome room and she’s on the TV, but as he starts to whip the TV, she changes to Masha. Max wakes up in his apartment and finds Masha in bed next to him, bound and whipped, dead. He calls Harlan and has him take pictures of what’s in his bed, not believing it to be Masha, but Harlan sees nothing in his bed. He tells Harlan to check for any Videodrome footage from the previous night, but Harlan tells him there never was any transmissions. He brings in Convex and admits that he was playing prerecorded tapes to Max on Convex’s orders. They plan to use Max’s channel to broadcast Videodrome to the masses. Convex takes the tape they recorded of Max’s hallucinations and shove it into the hole in Max’s abdomen. Convex tries to use it to tell Max to kill his partners at the station. Max pulls the gun out of his chest and it grows cables tat snakes into his arm. He shoots his partners and escapes to go kill Bianca. She tells him she expected him and tries to escape in her “soup kitchen”. She shows him a tape of Videodrome killing Nicki so they could use her likeness to manipulate him. She gets the tape out of him and puts in a new one to turn him against Convex and Videodrome. Max hunts down Harlan, who tries to give him a new, fleshy tape, but Harlan loses his hand in the hole in Max’s chest. Before exploding. He tracks Convex to a trade show for his company and shoots him on stage, causing his body to rend itself open. He breaks into a condemned freight boat and finds another TV wit Nicki telling him that Videodrome still exists, but to kill it, he has to kill himself to be reborn. The TV explodes with human organs, and Max does as it says, shooting himself in the head. </p>
  <h3><a id="thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <p>I had heard about this movie, and I know about Cronenberg’s work. I’ve seen the Fly, but I didn’t expect this level of torture and gore. There was a lot of torture and visual violence body horror, which threw and put me off the movie a bit, but once it picked up, I was all in. I liked the commentary on the violence of TV and the way that TV takes over, and the allegory for violence on the screen invading real life. I know it was a real fear as TV was becoming more pervasive in popular culture in the 80s, but having the benefit of hindsight, I feel that it was extremely heavy-handed. James woods did much better than I thought he would. I assumed he would be chewing the scenery wholesale, but even when he easily could have been, he was very subtle.  I wasn’t taken out of the movie by the camera work or the music, so they must have worked for the movie, but nothing about them stood out to me. I was riveted by the content of the movie, and it kept me on my toes throughout. I had no idea what to expect next</p>
