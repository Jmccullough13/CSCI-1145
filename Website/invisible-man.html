 <h4>2020</h4>
  <h3><a id="summary">Summary</a></h3>
  <p>Cecilia drugs her boyfriend, Adrian, and takes a bag of things she had hidden away with her, moving silently and sneakily, turning off cameras and alarms in a high tech lab. She manages to escape over the wall of the compound and heads down to a road to wait for her sister, Emily. She gets into the car and Adrian arrives, shouting at her to get out of the car and return to the house. They manage to drive off, leaving him behind. Two weeks later, she’s afraid to step out of her friend, James’, house. Emily comes over to tell her that Adrian is dead of apparent suicide. She manages to tell James and Emily what Adrian did to her, which was control everything she did, said, thought, and often hit her. She’s able to go outside again. She gets a letter in the mail from Adrian’s lawyer/brother telling her that she’s in his will. At the reading, she’s left $5 million dollars. She uses the money to pay for her niece, Sydney’s, college fund, and starts putting her life back together. That night, she hears footsteps and goes to investigate, hearing things in the house. The front door opens and she goes outside to see what opened it, and next to her head a breath is seen coming from nowhere. That night, her blankets are pulled off and flashes go off like someone’s taking pictures of her. She gets up to get the blanket and something stops her, looking like footprints on the blanket. They start to move towards her and she calls for James and the blanket is let go. He comes in and sees nothing and tries to calm her down. She has an interview the next day for an architectural firm, but when she pulls out of portfolio to show her work off, it’s empty. She has a panic attack, passes out, and is sent to the hospital for blood work. She gets a call and they tell her she has a high amount of a drug she doesn’t take anymore in her system and she finds the bottle for the meds that she lost when she left Adrian’s house. She goes to see his brother to demand that he tell Adrian to stop, that he once told her that she could never leave him and he could watch her without her seeing him. The brother tells her that she needs to let him go and shows her pictures of his body. She goes to talk to Emily, but Emily rebuffs her, telling her she got an email from Cecilia that morning that says she wants Emily out of her life. Cecilia refutes the email but Emily closes the door on her. That night, Sydney tries to cheer her up but gets hit and she thinks that Cecilia did it. James takes Sydney out of the house and leaves Cecilia alone. She gets a knife, spills coffee grounds over the floor, and waits for him to make a move, asking why he’s bothering with her. She gets no answers, so she calls his phone and hears it ringing in the attic. She goes up to look for it and finds it, her missing portfolio, and a knife in a bag. The phone gets a text that says “surprise” and when she goes to the attic opening, she hears a noise. She drops a bucket of paint in the opening and it reveals a head and shoulders of a figure. The figure runs off, leaving Cecilia alone in the attic. She climbs down and, hearing the faucet running, goes to turn it off, seeing paint in the sink, when she gets attacked, raised into the air and slammed into the wall and dragged across and pinned to the ground. She gets away by smashing some plates into his head and running outside. She calls an uber to take her back to Adrian’s house, where she goes into the lab to find the suit he was working on, turning it visible again. She takes the suit and hides it in the bedroom closet where she hid her bag. He opens the door and tries to attack him, but he throws her out. She escapes and gets back to the city, meeting with Emily at a restaurant. She tells her about Adrian’s suit, but as she is, he cuts her throat and puts the knife in her hand. She’s arrested and taken to a psychiatric hospital. As she’s being interviewed by James and another police officer, she tells them that she has proof he’s alive, but she can’t tell him in case Adrian’s there. James only tells her that he failed her and shouldn’t have left her alone. A nurse tells her that the blood tests that were taken also shows that she’s pregnant. Adrian’s brother arrives at the hospital to tell her that the payments are to stop because of her charges, but she can make it all go away if she goes back to Adrian and has the baby. She refuses, and he says he’ll be back again in three days. She steals a pen and tries to stab herself in the wrist to get him to show himself and stabs him with the pen, messing up the suit. She escapes, running into several guards, but he knocks them all out or shoots them, fleeing in the process. She grabs a gun and follows him out into the parking lot in the rain. He pins her against an ambulance and threatens to kill Sydney. He leaves, forcing Cecilia to steal a car to follow and stop him. She calls James to get him to go to her and keep her safe. He gets into the house and goes into Sydney’s room, dragging her into the hallway. James arrives and stops him from killing her, but Adrian attacks him and knocks him out. Cecilia arrives and sprays him with a fire extinguisher, revealing him, and shoots him. When she takes the mask off, it’s the brother. A swat team breaks into Adrian’s house and finds him tied up in the basement. James tells Cecilia this is her best chance to get free, but she refuses, saying she can’t be until Adrian is gone. She goes back to James’ house, but decides to call Adrian to end it. She goes back to the house where he tries to butter her up. She deflects and tries to get him to tell the truth about the entire thing, but he sticks to his story of his brother abusing him. He tries to talk calmly to her but sounds deranged. She goes to the bathroom, and Adrian’s knife lifts itself into his hand, into the air, and cuts his throat. She returns and screams, calling 911, but when she hangs up, she calms down and says “surprise”. When James arrives, he sees her coming out of the house, looking calm, and she tells him it’s over. He sees the suit in her bag, but, looking very unhappy, says that he did kill himself and that it’s over.</p>
  <h3><a id="thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <p>I was expecting something a little more of a psychological thriller out of this movie, but it pleasantly surprised me. It is a psychological thriller, but it also has great horror moments, particularly in the early stages of the setup, which was great for setting up the tension and drama of the story. Some parts were contrived, though, such as James’ house. Why would a young girl alone leave any door unlocked? Did the suit have the world’s quietest soles as well as become invisible? Why did Emily not immediately reach out to her sister about the email? Was one email all it took for their relationship to end, for sisters? How did she get the suit on and off so quickly before he died of a throat slitting, which is incredibly lethal. Too many contrivances needed to happen to push the story along. That doesn’t make this a bad movie, far from it, but it does come off as suspension-breaking. The suspense and tension in the beginning, before she figured out what was going on, was superb. The camera shots on nothing was great, making me search over and over the screen for what was going to happen. But after she figured out who and what was happening, the movie quickly slipped into thriller. I enjoyed the horror aspects of it in the before part, and I wished there had been more than that. The acting was amazing, especially Cecilia, the camera work was great, and the music was spot on, especially in the beginning, adding to the emotions being evoked rather than forcing them from the audience. Overall a good movie, but could have been better. </p>
