 <h4>1998</h4>
  <h3><a id="summary">Summary</a></h3>
  <p>A man, standing on a bridge in a brightly lit city, checks his watch, and it stops at midnight. He walks off into the darkness. John wakes up in a tub, in a dimly lit room, with blood on his face. Dressed, he leaves the bathroom to find a suitcase with a postcard that brings a flashback of a beach. He gets a call from the man with the watch, who tells him he has no memory due to an experiment gone wrong and to leave now. John sees a body with spirals carved into it. He leaves as three tall pale men in black coats exit an elevator and head towards him. In the lobby, everyone is asleep until a clock chimes and they all wake up. After he leaves, the desk clerk goes to him room to find the three men investigating inside. They ask where John went, and put him to sleep with a touch. Emma, John’s wife, gets a call from Dr. Schreiber, John’s doctor, who asks her to come see him, where he tells her that John’s been feeling betrayed by her and left three weeks ago. He reveals to Emma that John has had a psychotic break and lost his memory and asks her to call him should John contact her. At the hotel John was staying in, a new desk clerk with the memories of the old one is talking to the police about John before they go to his room and find the body. John walks through the streets, trying to remember anything about himself, and goes into a diner, where the cashier tells him he left his wallet there. He places it in a glass case that John can’t get into and John, desperate to leave as officers walk in, stares at it until it, waves coming off of his head, until it pops open. He tries to leave, but the officers stop him, questioning him until a woman, May, walks in and gets them to back off. She leads him out of the diner and down an alley to her home. In the hotel room, a detective, Frank, is speaking with officers about the body being the sixth hooker dead. A man runs in and is tackled to the ground, handcuffed, and dragged out, revealed to be a detective who went crazy. Frank goes to the other detective’s office and sorts through his notes when Emma comes in, wanting to file a missing person’s report. Frank tells her that he’s wanted for murder of six women and she leaves, upset. In May’s apartment, she starts to undress in front of him as he asks if she’s worried about him being the murderer. He sees a little kid in her apartment and leaves. He sees a sign from his postcard across the street and climbs a scaffolding to investigate it and finds articles about the killings. As he freaks out, the pale men confront him, and one tries to make him sleep with the wave of his hand, looking surprised when it doesn’t work. He moves towards John, a knife in his hand, but falls through the scaffolding when a board breaks. The other two men pull out knives and John’s eyes change color as he causes the boards to break under them, dropping one into a rope below. The first pale man flies back up and attacks John, causing him to fall through the scaffolding. He pulls on some ropes to climb back up, knocking part of the sign into one of the man’s head and breaking it open. The other men fall to the ground, clutching their heads in pain, as something liquefies out of the broken head. Deep underground, the remaining men report to a large gathering of similar pale men who express sadness of the other’s death. An older man comes out and tells the gathering that they need to have John because of his powers. He sends some men out to find him. Emma arrives at home, and when she comes out of the shower, John is waiting for her. He expresses his confusion about the keys in his pocket and who she is, and she tells him about Dr. Schreiber. He asks why he was seeing a doctor and she tells him she had an affair. She tells him that the police are looking for him, and he insists that he’s not a killer, telling her about May being a test to make sure that he wasn’t capable of murder. John tries to leave and Frank stops him, insisting he turns himself in. Emma shoves him, allowing John to leave. Trapped against a wall, he causes a door to open in a wall that Frank can’t see, dropping Schreiber’s card. He takes a taxi to see Schreiber, asking the driver is he knows the way to the beach in the postcard, but the driver can’t remember the way. Frank beats him there, confessing to Schreiber that he doesn’t think John is a murderer before leaving. Schreiber leaves, and John follows him to a health club, where he sees Schreiber talking to a pale man, who wants to know why John can use powers. Schreiber tells him about the experiment, an injection, but it failed and he lost his memories, and the pale man leaves after telling Schreiber to go through John’s memories again. Frank goes to see the other detective who tells him about seeing something in a previous case that broke him. John follows Schreiber out of the club, but loses him when he goes into a door in the wall that disappears. Schreiber goes underground with the pale men and is looking through memories that have been collected through the city when the older man, Mr. Book, comes in and lifts him up and out over a pit with his mind, demanding to know how John could learn so easily when it took the pale men lifetimes. A gong sounds, and the men all file into a large room. Book tells them to shut it down, and a clock appears, striking midnight. Everything in the city above stops moving and the people go to sleep, everyone but John, who wanders around, trying to figure out what’s happening. The pale men turn towards a large device, which shifts and turns into a large skyscraper. The entire city begins to twist and churn, changing buildings and structures, growing new buildings and erasing others. John sees Schreiber leave the underground, with pale men carrying another man, who they place in a barber chair and Schreiber injects something into his forehead. They enter a home and inject the same thing into everyone inside’s heads while they change the house from a shabby run-down house to a large mansion. John confronts Schreiber outside, demanding answers about what’s going on, and Schreiber tells him that he can tune, what the pale men do and how they change the city, and the he can teach John how to control his powers to take the city back from the pale men. He runs off as another door appears and pale men emerge to collect Schreiber. Book and the pale men discover that their shifting and experimenting didn’t work because John exerted his own influence on the machine they used. The first pale man volunteers to take John’s memories to find out why he is such a threat to them and succeeds in adapting John’s memories. John reads the postcard and figures out someone to go and see, and when he asks directions at a newsstand, he sees the first night clerk from the hotel as the seller. The pale men go to May’s apartment to look for John as a next step, thinking he would go to somewhere similar to try and hurt Emma for cheating on him. John tries to find the beach and the person from the post card through the subway, but none of the trains leave the city. He encounters Wallensky, who tells him that the pale men are experimenting with people, taking their memories and switching them between people and the city, before jumping in front of a train, saying he had a way to get out. The pale man goes to see Emma, quoting memories of John’s to her, and leaves, causing her to go look for John. She goes to May’s apartment and finds May cut up like the body in the hotel. She flees and is caught by Frank. John breaks into an aquarium, looking for the person from the postcard, and finds someone claiming to be his uncle, Karl. He shows John pictures of John as a child and tells him that his parents died in a fire when he was younger. In the pictures, John has a scar on his arm, but he doesn’t have one in present day, leading him to believe the pictures are lies. In May’s apartment, Emma tells Frank that John had said he came to May’s apartment earlier to test himself, so she thought she could find help to find him. As Frank calls the police, Emma finds the little girl under her bed, drawing a picture of the pale men killing May. Outside, Emma and Frank have a conversation about how few people can remember the past, how Frank has an accordian from his mother, but he can’t remember when she gave it to him. John notices a clock close to twelve and asks what happened to the day. Karl calls Emma and tells her that John is there, and Emma and Frank leave immediately to go and get him, the pale man outside watching them. As they’re driving, the pale men stop the city again and tune it. John tries to escape out of the building but is stopped by the pale man. John drops him and demands to know what’s going on. The pale man tells him that the city is shaped and reformed based on memories of bygone eras and that the pale men reshape the city to try and learn from the inhabitants what it’s like to be human to blend in. John demands to know what they are and the pale man tells him that they use dead humans as vessels. John escapes into a building nearby as another building is pressing up against the one he’s on, crushing the pale man. After the tuning ends, John tried to go back to the aquarium but is surrounded. Frank and Emma drive between him and the men and they carry him off to the station. John tries to convince Frank of what’s going on, asking him about the daylight, and Frank gets upset. John tries again by levitating a book in front of Frank, stunning him to silence. John is allowed to talk to Emma, and he tells her that they probably never knew each other before the night they met, that nothing actually happened before then, and she responds that she feels that’s true, even though she remembers the life they had before the night they met. Frank is called to talk to the chief as the pale men come in to find John. They force the chief to lead him to them, but find the cell empty and kill the chief. Frank lets John out and takes him to Schreiber, where John demands answers. Schreiber tells John that he’s not crazy and tries to give him a syringe that has all the answers he needs. He tries to force John to inject it at gun point, but Frank stops him, taking his gun, and force Schreiber to take them to the beach. Schreiber tries to refuse, but John uses his powers on him. Schreiber leads them to a boat and tells them that they were all abducted and forced into the experiments, and that John is at the heart of an experiment they were running to find out if a man, placed in the situation of a murderer, would continue in that vein. They are dying and think that by finding what makes people human, they can find the souls and keep themselves from dying. Frank asks where they all were brought from and Schreiber claims not to remember. They arrive at a twisted doorway and Schreiber tries to escape, but Frank and John force him to go with them. Inside, they find a large painted wall of the beach and Schreiber tells them that there never was a beach. They break the wall down and find nothing but empty stars in space. The pale men show up with Emma and try to capture John and Frank but Frank grapples one out of the hole, through a barrier, and into deep space, revealing the city to be a large ship kept in by a barrier, floating in space. John allows himself to be taken rather than let them hurt Emma. He wakes up strapped to a table and the pale men say that he’s evolved. Book tells them that they can use John to finish their experiment and shut the entire city down. They tell Schreiber to inject him with their memories, but he injects John instead with the syringe he tried to inject him with earlier. The syringe is filled with memories designed to teach him to use his powers and make him think he’d done so his whole life. He escapes and starts to wreck the pale men’s area, but Book stops him and they clash with each other using their powers. They break a hole beyond the city, causing debris and people to be sucked upwards. Book and John stop themselves in midair and Book throws a knife at John, who turns it back on him, causing a tentacle-like creature to come out of him and disintegrate. John asks where Emma went and Schreiber tells him that they’ve already erased her memories and imprinted her with new ones. John uses his powers to start the machine again, reshaping the outside of the city into a beach. The pale man finds him and asks him if it’s what he really wants, but John tells him he never wanted what the pale man thinks he does because he was never that person. He makes the city face the sun and exits onto the beach, where he finds Emma, now Anna. Together, they leave and walk down the beach.</p>
  <h3><a id="thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <p>So…not a horror movie, strictly, but I’d seen the other big horror movies for this year, and this had horror elements, what with a secret society of aliens creeping around in the dark and moving people and memories around. This was not a bad movie, but could have been better with some script tweaks and less action scenes. All of Emma’s parts could have easily been cut and nothing would have been lost, or at least her whole “love is the thing they can’t give us” point could have been done better. The final climactic “battle” was so overdone with effects that I couldn’t really tell what was happening. The “waves” coming out of their foreheads when they used their powers was also incredibly cheesy and would have been better off as nothing at all. I think people can infer that someone has psychic powers if they concentrate and something floats nearby. The music was generic actiony sci fi fare and not memorable, the camera work was decent for the most part, except that final confrontation. I’d watch this again, because I definitely think I’d get something out of it on a second watch, something I missed, because there was a lot going on, but for a first watch, it was decent.</p>
