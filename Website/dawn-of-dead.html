 <h4>1982</h4>
  <h3><a id="summary">Summary</a></h3>
  <p>In a newsroom, people are arguing about the true nature of the ghouls, with people saying to kill them or to give them a chance because they’re “human beings”. A militia group raids a hotel where people are hoarding weapons and kills many of the defenders of the hotel. One of the men in the group is killing indiscriminately, kicking down doors and shooting first. After he’s shot, they find room with some zombies in it and accidentally unleash them on the hotel. After they’re dealt with, two of the group, Peter and Roger, escape to the basement and find a boarded-up room of zombies, which they kill while the zombies are eating. They escape to meet with some people from the newsroom, Stephen and Francine, who have a helicopter, and after a brief run in with some police officers escaping on a boat, they take to the sky. They pass over scenes of zombie hordes and civilian groups trying to take care of their areas. They stop at a shopping mall to get some rest and try to find some food and Peter and Roger decide to clear the mall of zombies so that they can look around and find supplies. While they’re searching, Stephen gets trapped by a zombie in the basement of the mall but manages to escape and catches up with Roger and Peter. The three of them decide to stay in the mall for a while longer to catch up on the outside world, using the ductworks of the mall as a system to travel around and avoid the zombies. Franny is trapped in the roof access room by a zombie, is rescued by the others, and they find out that she is pregnant. They get some news from the outside about the nature and spread of the zombies and that some have been using tools. Peter spots some trucks and trailers and they use them to block the entrances to the mall to keep more zombies from getting in. Roger is attacked while trying to hotwire one of the trucks, escapes, and starts getting too cocky and arrogant about killing the zombies before he gets bitten. After barricading the doors from the inside as well, they start trying to kill all of the zombies inside. They clean all of the corpses out of their living area and proceed through various scenes of doing things in the mall, such as trying on clothes, playing in the arcade, and trying different kinds of food. Roger dies from the infection of the bite and Peter is forced to shoot him. More time passes and Franny is showing her pregnancy more while getting set up to have the baby in the mall, but they are getting tired of living in the mall and of their situation. Stephen teaches Franny to drive the helicopter in preparation of moving on. A group of raiders spot them and try to attack the mall, destroying the zombies around the mall to get in. Peter and Stephen try to close the gates at the doors, but they manage to get in anyway, turning all of their attention to looting instead of killing the zombies. Stephen gets upset and starts shooting at them, drawing their attention to him instead of the zombies. Peter joins the gun fight, covering for Stephen while he escapes. The raiders are driven off by Peter, but not before Stephen is shot in the arm. Zombies swarm into the mall, eating the raiders left, and they get Stephen while he’s trying to escape into the duct system. Franny wants to escape, but Peter wants to wait for Stephen. Stephen comes back as a zombie and leads the others to where they had been living in the mall. Peter tells Franny to leave while he stays and holds them off, choosing to die in the mall. He gets trapped in his bedroom while the zombies chase after Franny onto the roof. As the zombies break in, Peter changes his mind and hurries after Franny, getting onto the helicopter as it’s taking off, and they escape from the mall.</p>
  <h3><a id="thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <p>I wanted to like this movie a lot more than I did. I love the first movie and was expecting great things from the sequel, but I was let down. I loved the opening, how it just dropped the audience into the action. Just a brief moment of exposition to remind the audience that there are zombies before jumping into the action. However, the zombie actors were kind of silly and the leads themselves lost me pretty early on. Franny was sarcastic about how she was being treated but wasn’t trying hard enough to change it. Peter and Roger were too jokey about their situation, and Stephen was too bland. They spent too much time playing house in the mall, and there were too many action scenes and not enough creeping dread like in the first movie. I understand that the montages were meant to be a way to show how they were coping with the apocalypse, but I felt that they went on for too long and were too numerous. The happiness of the high of having all of this to themselves quickly changing to the down of them getting tired of it was well done but could have been done in a better way than montages. The music was cheap and waaaay too pervasive. None of it felt like it matched any scene, and when I heard the opening music from "Monty Pyhton and the Holy Grail", I checked out. When the action in the end started, it seemed that something was going to happen, but it was a bunch of pointless action scenes. Finally, at the end, I got the terror I wanted, which was the zombies swarming. That was overwhelming, and it even had, finally, music that matched. Again, I wanted to like this, but I just couldn’t bring myself to do it. </p>
