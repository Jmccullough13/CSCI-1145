 <h4>1984</h4>
  <h3><a id="summary">Summary</a></h3>
  <p>The movie starts with an exposition about pollution, particularly in Tromaville, which has the highest toxic pollution percentage in the world. Melvin, a janitor at a gym/health club, is picked on by some customers Bozo and Julie in a hot tub when he accidentally puts the mop in the hot tub. Slug and Wanda, two other bullies have a date night in the locker and Wanda, looking at an article about hit-and-run victims, asks Slug to go out with him and Bozo next time they go driving fast and run someone down. Melvin walks in on them and gets yelled out. All four of them are in a car and run down a kid on a bike, and Wanda and Julie take pictures of the corpse. As Melvin is cleaning the glass nearby, the four of them come up with a plan to get rid of Melvin, and Julie lures Melvin to the girl’s locker room and pretends to seduce him, telling him to put on a pink leotard and tutu. Some truck drivers carrying highly toxic waste stop their truck nearby to snort cocaine. Melvin kisses a sheep in the dark before the lights are turned on and the entire gym laughs at him. He dives out the window and into a toxic waste barrel. He writhes on the ground, burning, before running off. He makes it home and into the tub, where his body starts to bubble and twist and his hair starts to fall out and he runs out against the sunset. On a street corner, Cigar face and two goons assault and are about to kill him when Melvin comes in and stops them, killing the goons before Cigar face runs off. The cop makes it back to the station and tells the press about what happened. The mayor talks to his lackeys about what happened and they complain about how Melvin stopped them from earning more money. Melvin tries to go home but his mother screams at him and locks the door, forcing him to live in a toxic dump. The mayor talks with some other men about moving the toxic waste dump from near the river front to near the reservoir. At a taco restaurant, three goons hold the up the customers. One of the men in the restaurant tries to defend the others and is shot, and a blind woman, Sara, is almost assaulted before Melvin steps in, tearing one of the goon’s arm off. putting another’s head in a milkshake stirrer, and forcing the third’s hands into a fryer. He puts the armless one into the oven, then takes the Sara home. The police arrive at the restaurant and get the story about a monster killing the robbers from the workers while eating all of their food. The city holds a press conference where a doctor talks about how the “monster” only attacks bad people. At the gym the next day, customers are buying drugs from another patron, who gives the money to the mayor. Melvin comes in, scaring everyone else off, and kills the man using a weight machine. While Wanda is spending some quality time with the pictures she took of the hit and run in a sauna, Melvin comes in and shoves her onto the sauna coals. Outside, Melvin is approached by a pimp offering him a young girl. Melvin attacks the pimp and his goons and escorts the young girl home to keep her safe. Bozo and Slug try to run down some kid and Melvin scoops them off the road. A montage plays of Melvin helping people and them spreading the word about how he’s a hero and how he’s cleaning the streets of crime. The mayor and some goons try to spring an ambush on him, including Cigar face, but he leaps over their shots, causing them all to shoot themselves. Another montage shows romance budding between Melvin and Sarah and them moving into the dump together. Melvin tries to strangle Julie in the gym, she escapes, and he chases her into the basement and kills her with scissors. Bozo and Slug, waiting for Julie and the car, kill an old woman and steal her car. They try to run down Melvin, but he jumps on top of the car, rips Slug out, and confronts Bozo about running people down, to which he responds that he’s a “stressed person.” Melvin rips the wheel out of the car and they drive off of a cliff and explode. Melvin attacks a woman at a dry cleaners and tosses her into the washing machine before putting her in dry cleaning press. Melvin comes home and confesses to Sara who he really is and what he does and that he’s afraid that he’s going out of control. They leave to hide out in a campground to lay low. The mayor holds a press conference to call for Melvin’s arrest and death for killing the woman, despite finding out that the woman was an international slave ring leader, covering it up to get the public to turn against Melvin. The police lead a manhunt for Melvin and find him at the campground. The mayor calls for the national guard and they surround Melvin’s tent. The mayor orders everyone to fire on the tent, but citizens jump in and stop them from shooting. Everyone else refuses to fire, leaving only the mayor to shoot at him. Melvin advances on him, deflecting the bullets, and kills the mayor with a punch to the guts. </p>
  <h3><a id="thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <p>The bullies at the beginning couldn’t act, chewing the scenery like Pacman. I legit stopped the movie for five minutes to laugh at the facial expressions of Bozo, and in hindsight, that should have been an indication of things to come. There was no acting in this movie, and I’m surprised there was any scenery left in any scenes. The bullies and villains were so over-the-top evil that I couldn’t really get into the movie at all. Night on Bald Mountain kept playing whenever Melvin was doing his avenging, and I’m so used to the Disney use of the song that I couldn’t mesh what I was seeing with what I was hearing…The effects on Melvin’s transformation were decent. In fact, the effects were one of the only thing this movie had going for it. The other was that not a single scene was wasted. Every scene built on the plot, so I guess it had that going for it. The best part was the scene focusing on the tent before zooming out on a tank right in front of it. This…was so bad, yet so funny, but the humor alone couldn’t get me to watch this again. </p>
