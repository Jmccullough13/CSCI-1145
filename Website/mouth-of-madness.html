 <h4>1994</h4>
  <h3><a id="summary">Summary</a></h3>
  <p>An ambulance is bringing John in a straight jacket into a psychiatric hospital and put into a padded cell. Music plays on the loudspeaker before dying off. A hand breaks through the glass on his cell and a hooded figure appears behind him. He demands to know if it’s going to end like this, and the hooded figure says he doesn’t know how it ends, he hasn’t read it yet. Several days pass, and he’s asked only for a crayon, which he’s used to draw crosses all over his cell and clothes with. A doctor goes into his cell to talk to John, to find out how he got there. John asks how things are going outside the hospital before saying that he used to be an insurance investigator and what led to him being in the hospital started with the disappearance of an author Sutter Cane. Several weeks earlier, John is meeting with a man, talking about a warehouse that burned down before showing him pictures of his wife and mistress wearing clothes that were supposed to have been burnt in the building. While he’s having lunch with the head of his firm who wants him to look for a missing author, Sutter Cane, whose publisher is pulling an insurance claim on, a man with an axe walks out of a store across the street and breaks the window next to him. The man climbs in and asks John is he reads Sutter Cane, and John sees his irises are almost dividing, like cells, before the man is shot by police. That night, John sees reports of riots breaking out at bookstores as they can’t meet demand for preorder of Kane’s latest book. The next day, John meets with the publisher manager and Cane’s editor who tell him that Cane sent some chapters into his agent before disappearing. His agent was the one who had attacked John with the axe. His editor, Styles, tells him that Cane’s work has an effect on the less mentally stable. They don’t know where he lives, only his agent did, and that his work became erratic, that he started believing in it before he disappeared. Walking home, John sees an officer beating a man in an alley. He calls his manager and tells him that it’s obviously a scam, for publicity. The next day, John goes to pick up some of Cane’s books and is told by a store employee that he is being seen. While reading, he has a vision of the officer beating a man in the alley with a twisted, scarred face, before Cane’s agent and others come block the alley with axes. They all turn on the agent and chop him apart with axes, their faces mutating, while they eat his pieces. When he awakes, he notices that the book covers all have red lines on them, and after cutting them out and putting them together, he finds that they make a map of New Hampshire with a dot marking the town of Hobb’s End, the setting of one of the books. The publisher sends him and Styles to look for Cane there. They get lost on the highway and pass a young man riding his bike along the road. Some time later, they pass the same bike rider going to opposite way, but he’s an old man. Styles checks the map and looks up and they run into the bike rider, going opposite them again. He tells them that he can’t get out and won’t be let out, and when she looks up, he gets on his bike and rides off. They continue on, the road disappears and when Styles looks out of the window, she sees clouds below the tires. Light flashes, and they’re suddenly on a covered bridge in full daylight, arriving at Hobb’s End. John checks out some store fronts of the seemingly abandoned town and Styles sees kids chasing a dog, though John can’t seem to see them. They go to the hotel and Styles starts talking about each part of the hotel, describing it without seeing it, because it was described in Cane’s book. John doesn’t believe her, mentioning a church with black spires outside of the window, though he shows her a barn. She tells him he’s wrong, and that it’s from the east, and shows him the church. They go to look at it, reading from the book as if it were a guidebook, but Styles pulls him away as a fleet of cars pulls up in front of the church, men with guns getting out. The lead one calls out for his boy, and the doors to the church open, showing a small boy. The lead man goes to get him, but the doors start opening and closing rapidly, the boy turning into a man Styles identifies as Cane. A pack of Dobermans come around the corner of the church and attack the men. John yells at Styles about it being a set up, a publicity stunt for the next book, and Styles confesses that he’s half right, that they sent Cane away on a publicity stunt, but he never showed up. She was sent to make it look good for them and they weren’t supposed to find anything and that events are happening to them that are from the new book which only she and the agent know about. John goes to leave and sees a painting in the lobby with people mutated. While he’s talking to the desk lady, Styles takes the car, leaving him to walk through the town alone. In a bar, he meets with the lead man from the church who tells him something came out of the church and got to the children, which passed to the adults. At the church, Styles sees the kids she saw before, but they’re mutated and distorted. She goes into the church and follows a passage to the lower levels, where she finds a room with a desk and a typewriter set up on it. She heads out, but hears typing and goes back to see Cane. He tells her she can edit this book from the inside, that he thought he was making his books up, but that someone was telling him what to write. He looks at a door, which bulges and pulses with whatever’s behind it. He shows her the manuscript for the book and it glows brightly, showing her a jumble of images. In a trance, she tries to kiss Cane, but finds something growing on the back of his neck. John returns to the hotel and Styles drops on his back from the door, telling him not to look at the book. He goes to the lobby and sees the painting again, but it’s changed, with two tentacled creatures instead of mutated people. He calls for the landlady and hears crying, so he goes to look for the noise and sees the old woman, tentacles coming out of her chest and legs, hitting at her husband with an axe. John runs out and find Styles behind the bathroom door, shifting and changing, tentacles coming under the door. She comes out of the bathroom, smiling, and shoves him out of the door, breaking it. He drives off, but stops when he sees adults and kids, all mutated, dancing around Styles in the street. He ducks into the bar and meets the lead man from the church, sporting cuts on his face. He tells John that he got them from his five year old girl and puts the gun under his chin. John tells him not to, but he says he has to because he was written to. He pulls the trigger, sending John back into the street, where all of the people are now turned to watch him. He punches Styles out and shoves her into the car, but he can’t start it. Styles shows him the keys and swallows them, forcing him to hotwire the car to leave. Styles turns to try and kiss him, telling him that Cane is writing her to, and he jumps out of the car to see the bike rider in a phone booth. Styles climbs out of the car, her head low to the ground, telling him that Cane has a job for him, before crawling out on all fours, her body twisted with her chest upwards, her head turned around and smiling. John jumps back into the car and drives off, managing to find the highway, but the lines glow brightly and he finds himself back against the people in the streets outside the bar. He drives out again, seeing the bike rider with Styles behind him on the bike, and the line glow again, sending him back to the town. Same cycle again, and back in town, he decides to run the car into the people. They part for the car, revealing Styles behind them all. John tries to avoid her when she won’t move and runs into another car, passing out. He wakes up in a confessional booth in the church. A light flashes from the other side of the booth and Cane begins to talk to him about his work being religion. Cane tells him to read the new book, and sends John out of the booth into the room with the pulsing door. Cane tells him that he wrote John, that he was written to bring the manuscript to the publisher, and that the agent attacked him because he read about him from the parts that Cane had sent him. John refuses, but Cane opens a tunnel back to the outside, telling John to go because he can’t hold whatever’s behind the door any longer. Cane reaches up as a rip appears on his face and pulls at the tear, ripping at it like paper, and a hole opens where he had been, edges showing writing from the page of a book. John goes to look in the hole as Styles reads what he’s doing from the manuscript. As creatures and monsters pour out of the hole, John runs into the tunnel, tripping as the creatures fall upon him. A light flashes, and he’s back on the road near where they first saw the bike rider. A different kid rides up and points him to the highway before riding off. John drops the manuscript in the road and hitchhikes to a motel, where the manuscript is waiting for him. He burns the pages in the sink in his motel room and gets a bus back to the city. On the bus, Cane appears to John in a dream and tells John that he’s God now, proving it by changing everything to blue when he wakes up. He wakes up again, and everything is normal. When he returns home, he finds a government building and they tell him that Hobb’s End never existed. He goes to tell the publisher what happened, and he is told that Styles never existed, that he was sent to find Cane alone. John tells him that he destroyed the manuscript, but the publisher tells him that John delivered it to him months ago and that the book has already been published. John begs him not to distribute the book, but he’s told it’s too late. A radio news report states that the book is expected to surpass all records while an epidemic of violent crime has broken out. John is waiting outside a book store and ambushes a young man walking out with the book, killing him with an axe. John finishes telling his story to the doctor. The doctor asks about people who don’t read, and John responds that there’s a movie. The doctor leaves, and some time later, the power flickers and things are attacking the people outside his cell. Something rips the door off of his hinges, and in the morning, he finds blood and claw marks on the door. He finds the rest of the hospital torn apart and leaves, hearing a news report that people are mutating and attacking others and that they have lost contact with several large chunks of the US. John wanders into a movie theater and sees the movie for the book playing, the movie on the screen being the movie that we just watched. He starts to laugh, and the laugh turns into a wrenching sob.</p>
  <h3><a id="thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <p>This is the fourth of five movies on this list that I had previously seen, but just like <a href="thing.html">The Thing</a>, I love this movie. It’s a cross between Lovecraft and Stephen King and it perfectly exemplifies both writers, though it leans more on Lovecraft, which is fine by me. So much of the creeping dread, the creatures, and the fear of the unknown came from Lovecraft, but the part of the lost town trapped in the mind of a writer felt like Stephen King. Everything is great about this movie, the lighting, the camera shots, the music, and of course, the effects. The monsters look so much like Lovecraftian nightmares that I wouldn’t be surprised if Derleth or some other mythos writers were hired as consultants. <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000554/">Sam Neil</a> is not pulling his very tippy top A game that he did in "Jurassic Park", his previous movie before this, but it’s pretty close. He only let his accent slip once! The rest of the actors were simply there to add to the atmosphere, most of all Styles, and while not the best, they were good enough at what they were doing. The writing is what truly makes this movie shine. This is not the best movie on the list, but it’s very up there. n</p>
