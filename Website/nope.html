 <h4>2022</h4>
  <h3><a id="summary">Summary</a></h3>
  <p>A sitcom plays over the studio logos with “live studio audience” laughter, but pops and cracks stop the speaking, and a chimp, covered in blood and wearing overalls, walks up next to a prone body, tapping the foot to make them move. On a horse farm in California, OJ is tending to the horses. He talks to his father about the state of the farm and walks off, but he hears pinging noises on the metal roof and turns to see his father fall off the horse he was riding. At the hospital, they find a nickel lodged in his head. When he returns to the farm, he finds a key lodged in the flank of the horse his father had fallen off of. Six months later, OJ and Emerald, his sister, are on a film set to do a shoot with one of their horses. One of the set people flash something at the horse, something OJ warned them not to do, and the horse spooks, causing them to fire OJ from the shoot. They take the horse to a small wild west themed park to sell, and OJ tries to speak with the manager, Jupe, about trying to buy some of the horses back, but Emerald distracts him with a discussion of memorabilia from a sitcom show from the 90s about a chimp. He shows them props from the show and tells them about how the chimp lost its cool and wrecked the set and attacked people. At the ranch, OJ tells Emerald that Jupe offered to buy the ranch and they have a send off to their father. They see the horse that their father had died on, Ghost, outside. OJ goes to corral him and he runs off. When OJ goes after him, he hears something from Jupe’s park and sees the lights dim for a minute before coming back on. The house lights dim and come back on as well, and OJ sees something fly behind a cloud. He tells Emerald and she tells him that some places will sell a lot of money for a UFO shot. They buy some surveillance equipment and a guy, Angel, from the store comes to the ranch to help install the equipment. During the installation, Angel talks about UFOs, but OJ’s not interested. Emerald arrives with a fake horse that she stole from Jupe, and when he arrives, she tells him she bought it. He invites them to a family show on Friday nights before leaving again. That night, while trying to create equipment to help his horses get used to working on a set, OJ sees a light go on in the barn. He goes to investigate and finds nothing, but when he turns the power off, it turns back on, and he heats thumping. He sees a figure, black with a white head, unfold itself in the distance and another emerge from a room. He punches one that gets too close and it reveals itself to be a worker from Jupe’s park, trying to prank them back. Emerald, watching the cameras, sees a mantis on a camera, and Angel calls to tell her one of the cameras went out. Emerald goes outrside to check on it and hears the horses panicking. She sees a shadow in the clouds and yells at OJ, who’s out trying to calm the horses, to run. The shadow flies overhead as he runs into the barn and flies off when he’s out of sight, but it comes back as a horse runs out through the fields. OJ watches as a horse is pulled up through the air into the shadow, and Emerald, trying to clear the bug off of the camera, watches the shadow, a slim craft, rise up from the ground and disappear over a mountain nearby. Emerald tries to get the cameraman from the shoot they were fired from, Antlers, to come and try and capture the thing on film, but he refuses them. Angel arrives and shows them a cloud on their footage that never moves, stays in place even on a time lapse speed up. They try to figure out what they can do with the shot. In a flashback to the day that the chimp lost it on the set, a balloon popping sets the chimp off and he viciously attacks the actors on stage. Jupe, hiding under a table on the set, watched the whole scene. The chimp sees him and approaches but doesn’t attack, instead reaching for a fist bump before he’s shot in the head by the police. In present day, Jupe puts on a show in his park, telling his audience that for six months, every Friday night, he sees a flying saucer in the sky. The first time he saw one, he was wrangling a horse. He brings a horse out to show the audience how it happened, and as he does, the audience sees a rope of colored flags hanging from a cloud. The craft is barely visible within the cloud, pumping out some mist to obscure it. The power goes out and sand begins to swirl around Jupe, and people are in a tight, compressed orange area that looks like tubing. OJ goes to the park to get his horse back and sees all of the people missing with only the horse still there. The craft is flying overhead and he tries to get the horse without being in the open. The craft descends and lands in the open clearing, knocking OJ out. When he wakes up, it’s dark and raining. He calls Emerald and tells her that the ship isn’t a ship, but a creature that ate the people and is getting territorial. The power goes out in the house and Angel and Emerald can hear faint screaming in the air above them as the rain suddenly stops above them before starting again. Outside, objects begin to fall from the sky, keys, wallets, inorganic things, followed by a rain of blood. OJ gets near the house and his car dies, but he can see the red rain around the house through the pouring storm. The rain suddenly stops above OJ and he looks out and above to see the creature above him. It drops the fake horse onto OJ’s car, missing him. When the sun rises, the power returns to the house and car and OJ makes it back to the house to find Angel and Emerald arguing about the merits of staying versus leaving. They make a break for Angel’s van, but as they do, the power goes out again as the creature flies overhead. It flies off and they manage to escape, going to stay in Angel’s apartment for the day. They go back to the house to tend to the horses and find Antlers waiting. He tells them that after he heard about the disappearance of 40 people near their house, he’s willing to help them get a shot of the thing and they make a plan to lure it out and get it in the open. OJ tells them that it’s still an animal and an animal’s spirit can be broken. Emerald steals some inflatable tube men and sprinkles them around the ranch to get the creature’s attention and used as a way to tell were the creature is. A man on a motorcycle comes up with a camera and tries to interview Emerald about the incidents at the park but she refuses, so he drives into the valley towards the park, but as he does, the creature flies overhead, killing his bike and making him fly off his bike. OJ goes to help him, but the creature returns and scoops him up. It tries to get some of the tube men before flying off again, but returns as OJ rides back towards the house, escaping as the creature flies over the barn. Antlers leaves his post with another camera and tries to follow the creature to get a better shot of it but is sucked up into it. It goes after Angel, but he ties himself to a barbed wire fence with a tarp, keeping himself from being pulled in. It then goes after Emerald, but as it does, it begins to unravel, looking like cloth and fabric, a green box at its center. OJ tries to get its attention off of Emerald to allow her to ride off on the motorcycle. It follows her after a few seconds as she rides back to Jupe’s park and releases a large human shaped balloon that gets the creature’s attention and draws it away from them. It eats the balloon and explodes, drifting off on the wind. Emerald picks herself up from the ground and sees OJ on his horse, waiting for her. </p>
  <h3><a id="thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <p>Nope-Another great outing from Mr. Peele. While not as good as <li><a href="get-out.html">”Get Out”</a></li>, I nevertheless enjoyed this movie. It was a very slow burn, as most of the first half consists of build up mixed with a subplot about Jupe’s past with a chimp, but once the action started it was nonstop. The creature itself was awesome, looking rigid as a spaceship, but as it got more agitated, I could see ripples in it, reminding me of cloth. Its design in the end, when it seemed to deflate or unravel before taking on a more aggressive form, was amazing, reminding me of an animal that expands itself to look more threatening. I read a review after watching the movie that likened it to a Lovecraftian monster, and I can see where they’re coming from. The acting was great, with <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2257207/">Daniel Kaluuya</a> giving a more nuanced performance than his<li><a href="get-out.html">previous outing</a></li> with Peele, and the others were great too, including a brief but incredible performance from <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000699/">Michael Wincott</a>, an actor I’ve loved since “The Crow”. The shots were great, the music perfect. I have little complaint about this movie aside from the slow pacing at the beginning and its biggest crime, a criminal under utilization of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0202966/">Keith David</a>. While not as well paced or chilling as “Get Out”, this movie is very well worth a watch.</p>
