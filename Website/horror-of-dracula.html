  <h4>1958</h4>
  <h3><a id="summary">Summary</a></h3>
  <p>Jonathan is let into Castle Dracula on the pretense of restoring books for the master of the castle, but is secretly a vampire hunter there to kill the vampire and his bride. He manages to stake the bride, but Dracula escapes, killing and turning Jonathan in the process. Jonathan’s friend, Van Helsing, arrives at the castle, finds and kills Jonathan, and returns to England and his fiancé, Lucy, with news of his death, but her brother and his wife, Mina, don’t tell her because she’s ill. Lucy is revealed to be letting Dracula in to visit her and turns her into a vampire. After her death, she is found to be trying to lure her niece away from the house to be fed on, but is caught and staked by brother and Van Helsing. The two watch outside Arthur’s house to make sure that Dracula can’t get to Mina, but she had already been infected by him and was found to be in their basement. Van Helsing and Arthur track him back to his castle and trap him in sunlight, turning his body to ash and curing Mina of her oncoming vampirism.</p>
  <h3><a id="thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <p>This movie is extremely campy and cheesy, but fun overall. <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001088/">Peter Cushing</a> and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001284/">Michael Gough</a> were the best part of the movie hands down. It’s a shame, because I watched this for <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000489/">Christopher Lee</a>, but he had maybe three or four lines. I am somewhat confused as to why they changed so much of the original story. They switched some characters’ roles, killed Harker outright, and skipped a massive chunk dealing with Lucy and her suitors, but the story didn’t suffer. It still flowed and didn’t feel disjointed. The female victims were hammy, Lucy in particular was chewing enough scenery that they probably had to make multiples of the same sets. There were also too many dramatic zoom-ins to create atmosphere instead of letting Dracula and Christopher Lee’s acting be the threat. It was also too actiony, with multiple chase scenes that didn’t result in much of anything. The fights scenes weren’t choreographed well, either.</p>
