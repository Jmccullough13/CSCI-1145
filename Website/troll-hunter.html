 <h4>2010</h4>
 <h3><a id="summary">Summary</a></h3>
  <p>Authorities have been sent a package of disks containing footage that they aren’t sure if it’s real or not, but after studying the footage extensively, they determine it’s real. A team of reporter are dispatched to cover a story about a bear poacher. They speak with officially licensed bear hunters and they say they don’t know this person. They find the poacher’s camper in a campground, but he’s no there, and they’re told that he stays out all night. When he returns, they try and ask him some questions, but he refuses. That night, one of them puts a bug on his phone line, and when he gets a call and leaves, they try to follow him and lose him. They opt instead to break into his camper. They find a bear that’s been shot the next morning and the bear hunter says no hunter killed it, but the tracks don’t match a bear tracks. The poacher moves his camper and the group follows him onto a ferry and into a different part of Norway. They see him put a tire under a bridge before driving off and onto another ferry, where they try to talk to him again, and he again turns them down. At another campground, they follow him into a blasting area and off of the main road. They follow him as he leaves his car and hear a noise in the distance. The man comes running at them, yelling “Troll” and leads them back to his car, retrieving Thomas, the main reporter, as he disappears. Thomas tells the others that something bit him, and the man patches him up before taking them back to their car. They try to pry information out of him about the troll, but he remains silent. They find their car totaled and covered in slime. The man, Hans, gives them a ride back to the campground and Thomas asks to film the man as he does his work. The man agrees to let them film him killing what bit Thomas as long as they do what he says. He wants to make sure that none of them are Christian before letting them go with him. He takes them back to the area they had been the previous night and demands that they scrub their body odor off of them in a creek and rub troll stench all over themselves, though it smells horrible. As they walk, they try and joke with him about Trolls, still not believing him. They find an area marked by a Troll and Hans calls a vet, telling them the troll is sick. The vet wants a blood sample. Hans makes the crew wait in a field so he can chase the troll out and make fun of trolls again. After some time, they feel the ground shaking and hear a roaring and shaking in the trees that Hans went into. Hans comes back and tells them to run and they see a large, three-headed creature emerge after him, hairy, wearing a loincloth, and a tail. As they flee, thy get separated, and the cameraman films the troll trying to find them in the woods. Eventually they all come together and Hans leads them back to the car, where he turns a UV light on and turns the troll to stone. Hans demands to know who is a Christian because the troll sniffed one of them out. Hans tells them that he’s letting them film him because he wants to stop having to do the job because of how difficult it is and hopes to spread the word to the public. They destroy the troll statue and a man from the wildlife board, Finn, arrives and tells them to stop filming. A van arrives with a dead bear to cover up for the dead cows in the area and make fake tracks to make it more convincing. Hans tells them that his job is to keep trolls from getting close to people, though tourists are disappearing, and there are too many trolls out and about. Finn’s job is to keep people from knowing about trolls and is angry at Hans for letting the group film. He tells them about the different kinds of trolls and that the extra heads are for show, mating, or to scare others off, and they can live up to 1200 years, but they are very stupid creatures. He has to fill out a form for each troll killed because the TSS, the agency regulating them, are massive bureaucrats.  He shows them how he lives, covering his camper in troll body parts to smell like them and avoid detection, and he has to sleep with UV lights constantly just in case. The next day, Hans hears about some sheep slaughtered and follows Finn to the area, where he has to lie completely to news crews about a Russian bear causing the deaths. Hans lures the troll back to a bridge using some sheep. It takes some time, but the troll shows up and takes the bait. Hans puts on a suit of armor and spreads some Christian’s blood t to get its attention. It batters Hans about, trying to bite him, but can’t make it through the armor, and when it goes back under the bridge, he follows, getting its blood before making it explode under the UV light. They take the blood to the vet and she tells them more about troll biology, that younger trolls explode in sunlight and older ones turn to stone. Hans goes to check on other troll territories and knows that they hadn’t left because there are tires on the edges of the territories and the trolls would have stopped to gnaw on the tires because they love tires. They head to the territory of the biggest troll that they know about, the size of a mountain, before going to investigate a farm that experienced troll activity and Hans says that three trolls rampaged through. They return at night to find the trolls and follow them to an abandoned mine, their lair, but no troll is there. Kalle demands extra troll stench to cover himself. They investigate the empty nest but leave when they hear a troll returning. They get trapped inside when the entire group returns to the lair and while they wait, Kalle spreads extra troll stink on. While they wait, Kalle tells them that he’s Christian and when he begins to pray, the trolls wake up and attack. They flee, Hans exploding them as they give chase, but one of them gets Kalle and eats him. They return to Hans’ trailer to find Finn trying to find the tapes of their filming. They chase him off and get a new camera person, Malica, a Muslim. Hans doesn’t know what would happen with trolls and a Muslim. After they outfit the car with spikes, they find the territory of the trolls and find every tree broken. Hans thinks that a jotnar chased them out and goes to check out the local power plant, which is supposed to keep lines that act as an electric fence for the trolls. A technician tells them that part of the lines has been broken for several weeks. Hans has to check out the territory to find out why a Jotnar would break out. In a cabin, Hans tells them that the government wanted to build a tunnel through a troll territory and forced Hans to go in and kill every troll in the territory to let the tunnel through. Thomas has an attack because of his bitten shoulder acting up. They hear a noise outside and prepare to use a UV light on the Jotnar. The vet calls Hans and tells him that the troll that but Thomas had rabies. Hans thinks it spread to the other trolls, which is why they were acting up. Hans lures the troll away from the cabin with a Christian song and the others give chase to see Hans try and flash it with a UV light, but it loses power. They fix the light, but have to let the troll chase them a bit to make it lose energy to get the light to work. After he flashes it again, he chases it back around to try and keep it from going underground so the sunlight will kill it. The troll wrecks the car and when they all get out, Hans tells them to leave before heading to the troll with a UV cannon. He turns the troll to stone and wanders off into the mountains. Finn arrives and the crew runs off, trying to leave with the footage. Malica manages to escape and finds a truck. Captions say that the crew has disappeared without a trace and that the government won’t confirm the existence of the TSS, but a clip is provided with the president of Norway indirectly confirming that trolls exist.</p>
  <h3><a id="thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <p>Another found footage movie and I loved the hell out of it. The cg was very, very good, the suspense and drama was built well, and the lore and world building was phenomenal. They came up with so many biological points for the trolls that it was almost believable. The best thing about this movie was <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0422151/">Hans</a>. His acting was so good that I truly believed he was a troll hunter tired of the shit job and just so used to it that nothing bothered him about it. He sold the movie and was an incredible delight. The others were good actors too, but he was far and away the best. The camera shots were great too, but it’s somewhat difficult to mess up found footage shots.</p>
