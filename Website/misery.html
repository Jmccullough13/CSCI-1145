 <h4>1990</h4>
  <h3><a id="summary">Summary</a></h3>
  <p>A writer, Paul, finishes writing a manuscript, packs it in his bag, and pours a celebratory drink before packing it and himself into his car and driving down a snowy road as snow begins to heavily fall. On a curvy road, he begins to skid and slide before his car rolls off the road and onto the slope, upside down. In a flashback, in an office, Paul, is talking to his agent, who asks him about killing his most popular character off. He said he wanted to get out of wiring her so it didn’t become his life. Someone uses a crowbar and pulls Paul from the wreckage, gives him CPR, and carries him back to their place. When Paul opens his eyes, he sees himself set up to an IV with a woman, Annie Wilkes, hovering over him, saying she’s his biggest fan and that he’s been out for two days, his shoulder dislocated, his arm broken, and his legs shattered in multiple places. Several days have past, and he’s starting to heal some. Annie tells him that once the roads open, she’ll take him to the hospital. Paul’s agent calls the sheriff in the town he was staying in to try and get someone to check on him, because he’s not been checking in. Annie tells Paul that she found him because she was following him because she knew where he was staying and had seen him leaving. He can’t call someone because the phones are down. She asks if she can read the new book he was carrying with him and he says yes. The sheriff checks in with the owner of the lodge that Paul was staying in to see if they knew what had happened to him. Annie tells Paul that she read the book and doesn’t seem happy about it. She’s upset with the swearing, claiming that no one talks like that in real life. When she calms down, she tells Paul that he’s hers, his and his creativity. The sheriff and his deputy/wife are driving and he sees a broken tree. He gets out of the car and tries to get down the slope but sinks into the snow, giving up before turning back and missing the tire sticking out of the snow. Annie comes home and shows Paul the new book of his that had just released, gushing about it. When Paul asks, she claims to have called his agent and that she would let him call the next day, and that once the roads were open the hospital would send an ambulance. She continues to gush about the main character, Misery, as she reads through the book. As she gets to the end of the book, Paul starts to look anxious. That night, Annie comes into his room and calls him a murderer for killing Misery in his book. She screams at him and shakes his bed, throwing and breaking things in the room. She leaves, telling him that no one will come for him because she never called them, before leaving the house. Paul tries to make it out of bed and to the door, struggling in agony, and finds the door locked. The sheriff talks to Paul’s agent, looking at an article about him being missing. Annie finds Paul asleep on the floor and lifts him back into bed, telling him that she wants to say something to him, and that her thoughts are sometimes muddled, which is why she didn’t do well on the stand in Denver, before bringing a grill in. She uncovers it and pulls out lighter fluid and his new novel, dousing it before handing him a match and telling him he needs to rid himself of the filth of it. She douses the bottom of his bed with lighter fluid while talking to him and he lights the manuscript. He starts to refuse to take the pills she gives him, hiding them in a hole in his mattress. Annie brings him a wheelchair and a typewriter with expensive paper, telling him he’s going to write a new book bringing Misery back. He tells her that the paper isn’t the right kind because it would smudge and she starts to get upset, starting to scream at him about not showing appreciation before slamming the paper onto his legs. When she’s gone, he picks up a bobby pin he found on the ground and uses it to pick the lock on his door. He finds a phone, but it’s not connected to anything. He accidentally knocks down a glass figurine, but catches it and puts in back backwards, before finding a shrine to himself. He tries to escape through the kitchen but can’t fit his chair through and desperately tries to make it back into the room before she comes back in, barely managing to cover his tracks. The police find Paul’s car in the snow, and many speculate him to be dead, but the sheriff finds the crowbar marks on the door and speculates that someone pulled him out. Paul takes apart some pills he found on his journey through the house and pours them into a paper packet, hiding it. He starts to write, but Annie tells him to start over because it’s not working right. She accuses him of trying to cheat his way out of the ending of the previous book. He writes some more and she gushes over it. He invites her to eat dinner with him to celebrate, and he pours on the charm, and he pours the powder into her drink but she spills her drink, leaving him looking devastated. More time passes, and he keeps writing, seemingly haven given in to his situation. One night, it starts to rain and Annie acts strangely, depressed and sedated. She laments that Paul is getting better and fears him leaving and shows him a gun that she has that she thinks about using on herself. She leaves, and Paul makes his way out of his room again, taking a knife from the kitchen. He sees a scrapbook of clippings about his disappearance and flips through, finding articles on her husband falling to his death, a nursing student falling to her death, a highly praised pediatrician dying in a coma, and every one of them had articles saying how Annie benefited from their deaths. After that are articles about babies in a maternity ward run by Annie being suffocated, and how she was arrested for their deaths. The rain stops, Annie returns, and Paul falls asleep. When he awakens, Annie drugs him. She ties him to his bed and tells him she knows that he’s been out of his room. She finds the knife and his bobby pin and uses a sledgehammer to break his ankles so that he can’t escape ever. Outside the sheriff’s office, Annie almost gets into an accident and he hears her shouting insults at the other driver. He goes to the library and finds the articles on Annie and finds a quote from her that matches one in the Misery books. He checks with the general store owner to see what she’s been buying and finds that she’s been buying typewriter paper. He goes to Annie’s house, and Annie drugs Paul again to hide him. The sheriff comes in and Annie tries to tell him that she’s been trying to write like him to cover her purchases and the typewriter. The sheriff searches her house while she makes him cocoa. Paul wakes up and makes noise, drawing the Sheriff’s attention, and Annie shoots him. She tells Paul that their time has come to an end and that she has a bullet for them both, but he stalls her by telling her that they need to finish the book first. When she goes to get his chair, he hides lighter fluid in his pants. After he finishes the book, he douses it in fluid and lights it on fire when she comes back. When Annie goes to put it out, he drops the typewriter on her head. They fight, shoots him in the shoulder, he shoves the ashes into her mouth, she shoves him off of her, and when she tries to escape, he trips her and she smashes her head on the typewriter. He tries to crawl out, but she lunges after him. He grabs a pig statue and hits her in the head with it, killing her. Paul has a meeting with his agent, who tells him that his new book is earning his rave reviews, but he tells her that he wrote it for himself. She asks about a book detailing the experiences in Annie’s house, and he says no. A waitress approaches and tells him she’s his number one fan.</p>
  <h3><a id="thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <p>Music is great, high and manic when Annie gets upset, somber and dark when Paul is in distress. Kathy Bates is a bloody genius in this movie! She switches between manic to innocent, using phrases like “heaven to Betsy”, but also darkly threatening without needing to yell. Cheery and bright, then dark and upset, instantly or slowly transitioning between the two seamlessly. I had to pause to soak in her brilliance. The camera work and shots are well done, masterfully building tension even with the simple act of picking up a bobby pin. I never know what she’s going to do next. Depressive states add a whole new layer to her acting. She overshines everyone in this movie. What kept it from having a higher estimation from me was the ending. It was too sudden, too abrupt, and too cheesey. </p>
