 <h4>2016</h4>
  <h3><a id="summary">Summary</a></h3>
  <p>A woman, Sara, receives a call from police in Tokyo to tell her they got a missing person’s report from her twin sister Jess’ workplace. They had reports that she disappeared into the Aokigahara forest, a forest where people go to commit suicide. They think she has, too, but Sara refuses to believe it. Her husband Rob tells her to wait before flying to Japan to look for her. She has a dream of Jess running through a forest and wakes, immediately packing and flying to Japan. She calls Jess to try and find her, but her box is full. While in her hotel room, she searches for information on the forest and finds morbid images of corpses and nooses. After having a dream of finding her sister young in her parent’s basement, and then she becomes a corpse, she goes to her sister’s workplace, a school, and tries to look into her classroom. When the kids in the classroom see her, they all scream, thinking her a ghost because they know she went into the forest. She speaks with a student and the principal in the main office and the student tells her rumors about the forest, that the people who die there are restless and return angry. The principal tells her that in old times, when food was scarce, the elderly, sick, and disabled would be taken into the forest to die to allow the rest of the family to survive. She looks through Jess’ room and finds anxiety medication and maps and brochures of the forest. She takes a train to the forest and checks in with travel center nearby to see if they’ve seen Jess. The woman says she has found her and takes Sara to the basement, where they keep bodies if they’re found. She shows her as body, but Sara claims its not her. Sara wants to search the forest, but she’s warned against leaving the path because yurei, the spirits, will get her if she has sadness in her heart. She meets an American man, Aiden, in the bar of an inn. He warns her against the forest as well and tries to dissuade her, but tells her that a group is going into the forest the next day to do a round of prevention and can get her into the group. He interviews her, wanting to write an article on her and her search, and she tells him that her parents died in a car crash, but they really committed suicide in the basement and Jess was the one to find them. She meets with the guide, Michi, the next morning, who also tries to dissuade her, but because she’s sad, but she insists. She, Aiden, and Michi head into the forest, and Michi warns them that if they see something strange, it’s not real, because people have seen things in the forest. They come across a man with a tent, and Michi tells them that if they have a tent, they’re not sure. Michi goes to talk to the man while Aiden interviews Sara some more. Sara tells him that Sara had tried several attempts before, but Sara got her to stop. They find some rope tied to a tree, which Michi says is in hope that someone will follow and stop them or find their body. They follow the rope and find a body hanged from a tree and Sara calms herself while they cut the body down. As they move on, Sara hears screaming and sounds like her name in the forest, and she makes a choice in a direction in the woods based on a feeling. They find Jess’ tent and her clothes hanging up and call for her, but find nothing. Sara wants to stay, insisting Jess’ll return, but the men try to dissuade her. When she is adamant, Aiden stays with her, though Michi tells them that at night, people do bad things because the forest draws on people’s sadness. As it gets dark, she claims that Jess is close and alive because she can hear a sound of her, and Aiden tells her about his brother who went deaf because of him. She goes to bed in the tent while Aiden sleeps outside. She has a dream of old women in white robes and when she wakes up, she hears twigs snapping nearby and leaves the clearing. She sees a girl in the woods and follows her. The girl tells him that she knows Jess and that she says not to trust Aiden. Aiden calls for her and the girl runs. When Sara chases her, she falls and cuts her hand open. Aiden takes her back to the camp for the night and in the morning, he leads her back towards the trail. They get a little lost, but find a river and follow it down to get out of the forest. Sara gets turned around, thinking the river is flowing in a different direction. She questions Aiden about his brother and finds that he lied about it to get closer to her. She gets his phone and finds a picture of Jess in her tent on it and when he attacks her to get the phone back, she runs deep into the forest, away from him. She finds a ball of twine and uses it as a guide through the woods while a voice tells her to turn around and a figure keeps appearing nearby her. She runs, dropping the twine, when the figure appears behind her, and drops into a cave, spraining her ankle. Michi finds the tent empty and leaves, returning with a police search party and Rob, who’s come to look for Sara. Sara moves through the cave, trying to find a way out, and hears someone singing her name. She finds the girl from the night before in the cave and she tells her to follow her to Jess while grinning. Sara follows and finds her stopped, her face turned into a grinning corpse. She runs back and calls for help and Aiden appears at the top of the hole. When he goes to look for rope, Sara finds a view finder that shows her memories of her parents’ deaths. Aiden returns with a rope and hauls her up. He tells her that he found a ranger station nearby, which she doubts, but he gives her a knife so that she can trust him, showing that she can defend herself if he does something. She goes to clean off her hand and thinks she sees maggots in her arm. She goes to cut them out but realizes they’re hallucinations and stops. Aiden leads her to a building he claims is a ranger station. They find a radio, as well as wrappers for a power bar that Aiden enjoys eating. He asks for the knife to try and fix the radio and she reluctantly gives it to him. While he tries to fix it, she finds a locked door and hears Jess on the other side. Jess slips her a note telling her that Aiden will kill them. She finds a knife in a drawer and holds to his neck, demanding the key. They struggle and she accidentally stabs him, and when she does, the door opens, revealing the basement to her parents’ house. She sees her parents bodies and her father comes to life, attacking her. She gets him off and flees through the forest, surrounded by dead people. Jess, at the camp, hears her screaming and runs. Sara sees her and chases after her. Jess sees the search party flash lights and finds Rob, who asks her if she’s seen Sara. Sara sees the girl from before, who looks at Sara’s wrists, which is cut. Sara realizes that she slit her wrists when she thought she was being attacked by her father and sinks into the ground. Jess realizes that Sara is gone because she can’t hear anything anymore. As they’re leaving, Michi looks back into the forest and sees the vague shape of Sara standing in the trees.</p>
  <h3><a id="thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <p>I had wanted to see this movie for years, and it didn’t disappoint. I was pleasantly surprised and delighted by this movie. It started slow, building to the forest, and it annoyed me how they spoke regular Japanese in chunks but slowed down important words so that American watching could understand what was being said was important. I know how Japanese is spoken and I know that they wouldn’t say those words so slow. That honestly was my biggest complaint about this movie. After that, it stayed the course and ramped up to the ending while being very well-paced. The scares built slowly as well until we got to the end and into the full blown paranoia that the forest was causing. I like the way they built Aiden as untrustworthy, though it could have been handled somewhat better. He never tried to argue against what she was seeing, such as the picture on his phone, which he could have and should have. I think that was pushing a little too hard to make him seem untrustworthy when all we needed was the lie about his brother. Sara’s descent into madness was done well, slowly building until the culmination at the end of her run through the forest, that was all in her head. She also showed all of the signs that were mentioned by Michi for people not sure if they wanted to die: staying in a tent, using the twine to allow someone to follow her. I also like how we weren’t sure if what she was seeing was real or in her head, though some of it was clearly the latter. I usually hate that kind of ambiguity, but it worked well in this case as being caused by the forest as an entity itself. Some of it was real, though, since Michi saw her in the forest as a spirit at the end. The acting was great, though Aiden could have done better. He felt like forced bluster at some points. The shots were good, the lighting was good for being shot in a forest. Overall a good movie with a few hiccups, but those don’t ruin the movie.</p>
