 <h4>1964</h4>
  <h3><a id="summary">Summary</a></h3>
  <p>Francesca and takes her father and lover prisoner. Prospero’s lover, Juliana, is demanded to clean up Francesca and make her presentable for court. In court, two small people, Hoptoad and a dancer, perform for the court, though the dancer is slapped when she gets too close to one of the nobles, Alfredo. Prospero takes Francesca on a tour of the court, comparing nobles to animals before telling them to act like animals, which they do so as not to anger him. He describes his life in his court and how his life goes, showing her colored rooms created for various purposes, forcing her to watch as her lover duels a trained guard in the dungeon with swords, all to indoctrinate her into his “religion”, Satanism. While on the tour, a noble and his wife attempt to gain entry into the castle but are killed for fear of spreading the red death. Juliana is completing the final rites into the “faith”, trying to impress Prospero to stay by his side. Juliana becomes jealous of Francesca and sets up a moment for her to try and rescue her lover and her father from the dungeons to escape. As they make their escape, the get to a soldier who was supposed to let them out, but he reveals himself to be Prospero and that he had allowed the “escape” for his amusement. He announces to the court that he is going to hold a masquerade, and Hoptoad convinces Alfredo to dress as gorilla, a symbol of power. During the dinner prior to the masquerade, Francesca’s father and her lover are brought to the court and made to play a game with knives. Prospero kills her father and has the lover thrown back into the dungeon. Juliana has a fit of hallucinations where she is visited by various gods and is told she had earned Satan’s favor, though Prospero has her killed at the beginning of the masquerade for her betrayal. The man in the red robes appears to Francesca’s lover and tells him to wait for Francesca. At the masquerade, Hoptoad enters with Alfredo in the suit and ties him up, punishing him for slapping the dancer earlier, before setting him on fire. Prospero thinks this is amusing, and with Francesca, who is losing her will to resist him, makes his way through the masquerade until he runs into the robed man wearing a tasseled mask. The robed man taunts Prospero and reveals himself to be the red death personified. Prospero tries to flee, but the red death follows, killing all of the guests as he chases, until he hunts down Prospero and takes off his mask, revealing himself to be Prospero consumed by the death. Everyone in the castle except Francesca dies</p>
  <h3><a id="thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001637/">Vincent Price</a> was much better in this movie than the <a href="pit-and-pendulum.html">previous film</a> with him that I watched, acting a supreme douchebag, but enjoyably so. I was enjoying this movie a lot until the Satanism reveal, and it hit a wall for me and couldn’t recover. Why couldn’t he just be a jerk for the fun of it? The power could go to his head and everyone else could go along with it to appease him out of fear, such as with the animal scene. Did he really need to be evil for the sake of Satan? This movie would have been a lot higher on my list and better to me had the whole Satanism angle been cut. It didn’t need to have some cosmic reason behind his behaviors and attitude. The devil and demon mention are the most painful thing in this movie, more so than Francesca and her preachiness. This movie would have been so much better without the religious overtones. Juliana’s vison quest was completely unnecessary, only meant to pad out the run time. In fact, her entire character was pointless except to show further cruelty of Prospero, which was done well with other scenes. Prospero’s death scene was well done and acted, though he went a little hammy in passing through the “dead” guests. Could have been great, but it hit a wall hard and couldn’t recover.</p>
