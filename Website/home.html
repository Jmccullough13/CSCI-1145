 <h3 class=">My Mission:</h3>
 <p>This Halloween season, I’m embarking on a quest that I’ve long wanted to undertake: To watch one horror movie a day every day from a different year, in chronological order. My wife, for better or worse, will be joining me on this journey. I will watch each movie and, on an individual page on this site, provide a summary in my own words for the movie and my thoughts on the movie, as well as a rating out of five. On another page, I will rank each movie in terms of how much I enjoyed the movie, how good it was, and how receptive I am to watching it again in the future.</p>
 <br>
 <p>My original intention was to watch the best horror movie of that year, but “best” is subjective at best and divisive at worst. I then turned my intentions to the highest critically rated movie of the year, but the fact that we’ve seen many if not most of those movies already was pointed out to me, so we made a compromise and decided to find a highly rated movie from each year on the list that we’d never seen before (a few exceptions have been made). I also had planned on starting at 1960, foolishly thinking that many movies starring Vincent Price fall into those years. I soon found the error of my ways and included two movies I had been excited to watch from 1958. After these movies, I jumped to 1960, and proceeded from there, watching one movie from each year</p>
 <br>
 <h3 align="center">About Me:</h3>
 <p>I am an avid horror buff and have always been so, as long as I can remember, anyway. I remember, as a child, checking out books on every Universal Studio monster movie and reading them relentlessly. From there, I expanded my interests to Godzilla properties, and then onto vampires, zombies, aliens, and any other horror genre that I could get my hands on, as long as it contained fantastical elements. I first watched Gremlins when I was eight, and my life was forever changed. Side note: While I say that I’m a horror buff, I generally try and stay away from formulaic slasher movies, especially those with five thousand sequels. I also don’t count psychological thrillers as horror movies, because while they contain horror elements, horror isn’t what they’re focused on. </p>
