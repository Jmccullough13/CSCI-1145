 <h4>2018</h4>
  <h3><a id="summary">Summary</a></h3>
  <p>Soldiers are flying over the Atlantic in a convoy of ships and planes to the shores of France on June 6th, 1944. The soldiers are chatting with each other before the sergeant comes in and reminds them of their mission, to take down a radio tower to cut off Nazi communications. They break through a cloudbank into a barrage from the ground and several in the plane die from bullet wounds and the engine exploding. As they line up to jump out, the rear of the plane explodes, killing most of them. Boyce is last alive and the sergeant throws him out of the plane. His parachute deploys too late, but he lands in water, and after cutting himself free, he makes it to land and finds the remains of his squad. He takes a gun and hears the sergeant’s voice. He sees him surrounded by Germans and he tries to help but Ford, another soldier from the plane, stops him before he can get killed. They rendezvous with three others, Dawson, Chase, and Tibbet. Dawson steps on a mine and explodes. The other four make their way into a forest nearby and find a strange corpse of a dog before coming across Chloe, a girl from the nearby village scavenging ibn the field. She takes them to her home in the village, where she lives with her 8 year old brother Paul and her sick aunt. They hole up in the attic near the church and Chase and Tibbet go to scout a way in. Boyce goes to watch the door and sees the aunt, who’s lumpy and misshapen. Chloe tells him that she was released from the church and hasn’t spoken a word since, so she doesn’t know what’s wrong. She tells him that the captain in the village takes people from their homes and into the church for experiments, but it’s just an excuse to kill people. The captain comes into their home and makes himself at home. He tries to force himself on her, threatening to send Paul to the church if she doesn’t agree, which she does. Boyce jumps in to save her, forcing Ford to do so as well, and they knock the captain out and secure him. Boyce goes to find the other two and sees the Germans burn bodies who look like Chloe’s aunt, rejects from the church’s experiments. He’s chased by a dog into the back of a truck filled with bodies from the drop. When the truck stops, he’s inside the compound. He makes his way through, trying to find a way out, and finds a cells with people. . He finds other experiment sites, including bags suspended above a pit with hoses feeding into them, filled with people, and makes his way into the head doctor’s office, where he steals a syringe of liquid. He hears someone calling for help and finds a woman’s head attached to only a spine still talking. He finds Rosenfeld, another member from their squad, tied to a table with a hose in his abdomen and pulls it out, taking him with him and escaping through a tunnel below the church. They get back to the house, Tibbet and Chase waiting, and he tells them what he found, including the syringe. They try to get answers from the captain, who only tells them that the people have been given real purpose by being experimented on. He mentions Chloe’s aunt and she stabs him in the leg. Ford hoists him up and tortures him for answers. Boyce wants him to stop because he thinks they’re better than the captain, but Ford says they have to act like them to beat them. When he’s done, he says there are forty men inside the walls and they plan to blow up the tower from the outside. Chase goes to get the captain but is attacked and shot. Boyce knocks the captain out again and they try to stop the bleeding, but he dies. Boyce injects him with the syringe and he sits back up, crushing the canteen as he gets a drink. As he stands up, his veins begin to bulge. He throws his head back and snaps his spine backwards. He attacks Boyce and Ford shoots him, but he stands back up. As he tries to attack Ford, Boyce knocks him down and smashes his head open. In the confusion, the captain slips away and steal Paul, using him as a shield. They kill some soldiers who try to help him, but he escapes despite being shot in the face. Ford tries to order Boyce to ignore the kid and carry on with the mission, but he refuses, insisting they can blow up the lab and tower at the same time. Tibbet agrees, and Ford is forced to go with their plan. While Chloe draws a soldier’s attention, Tibbet and Rosenfeld sneak onto the compound to try and draw attention away from Ford, Boyce, and Chloe sneaking into the church. The captain returns to the church and injects himself with two syringes against the doctor’s protestations. Chloe breaks from the others to find her brother, shooing a guard who refuses to show her, while the others go to find the tower. Ford sets the charges on the tower while Boyce sets them in the labs. The solider leads Chloe to a room with a mutilated torso and tries to shoot her, but Boyce saves her and leads her away as the solider is grabbed and pulled into the room. They find Paul in the lab and Boyce sends them out while he finishes in the lab. Chloe is attacked by a mutated person, and even as she shoots him in the head, it gets back up and chases her. She finds a flamethrower and torches him, finally putting him down. While setting the charges on the tower, the captain attacks Ford, and while Boyce is setting the charges in the lab, the doctor attacks him, but Boyce kills him with a scalpel. While in a firefight in the street, Tibbet sees Paul and runs out to get him, getting shot in the shoulder in the process. Chloe arrives and helps fight the Germans off to give them some breathing room. The captain impales Ford on a hook hanging from the ceiling and tortures him, stopping only to throw Boyce through a wall when he shoots him in the chest. Ford gets himself down, injects himself, and impales the captain with a pole while he’s trying to drown Boyce. They fight, but the captain wins, and while Ford’s on the ground, Boyce shoots a gas tank, blowing the captain up. Boyce tries to carry Ford out, but Ford pushes him out and locks him out, telling him that neither side should have the serum in the syringes and wants to bury it with himself. He lights the charges himself as several other men are revived with the serum and blows himself and the lab up. Boyce sets the charges on the tower and escapes the compound as it falls apart. In the village, people leave their homes to see what’s happening while Tibbet, Chloe, and Rosenfeld are listening to a report about the D-Day landing. Boyce walks into the town and collapses against a wall. Later, he’s reporting to a sergeant about the tower’s destruction, but when the sergeant asks about anything else in the building that would be worth digging up, he says there was nothing. Boyce returns to the others, folded into a new company, and tells them about their new orders and how they have a job to do.</p>
  <h3><a id="thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <p>Not a bad movie, but a lot of missed opportunity, especially for body horror. This could easily have been a WWII version of reanimator, especially with the talking head on a spinal cord, but it turned into some knock off super soldier cliché. We had glimpses of that body horror with Chase, the captain, and that head, but the other “reanimateds” we saw were just slicked up guys with veins painted on their arms who stood there and did nothing but wait to be blown up. Some wasted potential, but it wasn’t all bad. The acting was great. The actor who played Boyce was great at showing fear. The shots were good, none too shaky and no lens flares, which could have invaded this movie, and the shots all focused where they should be. The lighting was decent, but unfortunately, unlike the previous movies, most of the shots in this movie were on a set, and most definitely any forest shots. My only other complaint, aside from the wasted potential, was the title. There was no Overlord, so why go with the name? It makes no sense. A fine popcorn flick, but not a lot to recommend a second watch. </p>
