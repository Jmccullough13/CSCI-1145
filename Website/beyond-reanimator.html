 <h4>2003</h4>
  <h3><a id="summary">Summary</a></h3>
  <p>Two young boys are camping in a backyard when they hear something and go inside to investigate. The older boy’s sister hears something inside the house and when they meet up, a man missing an arm and his lower jaw comes in and kills the sister. An officer follows the man and shoots him and when they cart off the body, they also put an arm that’s still moving in an evidence bag They force another man, Dr. Herbert West, into the back of the squad card, and the older boy picks up a syringe of glowing green liquid as the car drives off. Thirteen years later, West is still performing experiments even in prison, this time on a rat. A nearby cell mate is looking for a rat that he feeds and is directed to West. A new doctor, Howard Phillips, is brought into the prison and West is put under his care by the warden, whom he meets with a reporter, Laura. A guard brings Phillips to the yard, where a patient, Moses, is having a heart attack, and the reporter has her leg injured in the kerfuffle. Phillips yells at the nurse for not having some medication and not helping when trying to resuscitate Moses and chases everyone but West out when Moses dies. He tells West that he was the kid whose sister died and shows him the vial, which he injects into Moses to see if it still works. When they think it doesn’t, Phillips tells him they can make more. West doesn’t think so with prison materials, and Moses revives, attacking a guard and biting his arm. The warden arrives and is attacked by Moses, but they subdue him and drag him out. They force West back to his cell, but not before he makes a list of supplies needed to make more of the reagent he uses. When Phillips leaves, he runs into the reporter and drives her home. The warden sees and gets upset before going to see Moses and demands what they gave him. Howard and Laura have dinner and she asks why he’s working in a prison. He tells her about his sister and West’s history, how he worked in the Miskatonic university hospital and worked on reanimating people, claiming that death is a disease. One of his experiments broke out and went crazy, resulting in Howard’s death. Howard brings West the supplies he asked for and they find a secret lab to work in. West goes about making his reagent while Howard works as the doctor in the prison and Laura researches West’s history on her own. Howard encourages Laura to take risks on her article, which is about West’s experiments and Howard’s past. Laura shows up at the prison to try and seduce the warden into giving her an interview and a chance to talk to Moses. The rat inmate threatens West for the disappearance of the rat. West and Howard bring the rat back to life, then use a new electrical agent to keep its aggression and violence down. Laura pays a guard to let her talk to Moses while West gives the rat back to the inmate rat, backing him off of West. Laura is attacked by Moses, who then attacks the Warden when he comes in to check on her, his ear getting bitten off. He kills Moses and threatens Laura for her silence, killing her when she tries to escape. West convinces Howard to inject Laura and they bring her back to life, and she starts to reenact her death, clutching at her throat. When the guards to get Moses’ body, they find it missing. The rat inmate finds Moses in his cell, trying eat his rat. A guard tries to come in to stop Moses and the rat attacks him. The warden finds the secret lab that West and Howard set up, and West knocks him out with a microscope. Moses kills the guard, and the inmate releases the other inmates. West uses the warden to create his new electrical agent based on a human to give to Laura to bring her reason back. When they tell her, she freaks out and her body starts to convulse and she speaks with two voices. The rat inmate finds West and tries to attack him before turning his attention on Laura. When he tries to grope her, she slaps him and runs off, the inmate chasing her. Howard tries to follow, but the remaining guards lock him in a safe zone with them to wait out the riot. The inmate catches Laura, but she strangles him in a fit of rage. West reanimates the warden using the electrical agent from a rat to try one last experiment on him before tying him up and leaving him for the inmates to find. He breaks loose and attacks West, knocking him out, before leaving the lab and attacking anyone he comes across. When he kills them, he reanimates them. Howard makes it back into the prison to search for Laura, who wakes with all of her attackers dead around her. Her fingers begin to spasm, bending forward and backward like clay. The warden finds her and starts killing other inmates to threaten her while another inmate steals the reagent from the bag the warden has, thinking them to be drugs, and injects them into his arm. Howard finds West and shoves him against the wall, demanding to know what he did to Laura, and West tells him that she may be in the death row house if the warden found her. They find a row of people being hanged after being reanimated, hanging while not dying. The torso of the rat inmate finds West and attacks him, but West uses a rope to throw it away. Howard finds Laura and she begs him to kill her because of what’s inside her. She changes, acting like the warden had when he was alive, and assaults Howard with a cane. West finds the inmate injecting himself with the reagent and watches as he explodes into pieces, some of the pieces still moving on their own. Howard tackles Laura to the ground and she seems to return to herself, but reverts and starts hitting him. West finds the warden, who is acting more like a rat than a human. West beats him into the electric chair and electrocutes him while Howard is forced to decapitate Laura at her own request. The SWAT team, come to restore order in the prison, finds Howard with Laura’s head in his lap and try to restrain him, but Laura’s head starts to laugh at him and he has a mental break. West steals Howard’s ID and breaks out of the prison, heading off into the night.</p>
  <h3><a id="thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <p>This movie is awful. It’s nothing but a cheap rehash of events that happened in the first Reanimator, but in a prison instead of a university hospital. The acting from everybody save one was abysmal, painful to watch. The music was cheap, sounding like knock off Danny Elfman drivel. The camera work was passable, at least, but the effects were horrible. The inmate reanimated as a torso kept having edges of his torso phase in and out of the background. The physical effects and makeup were bad, looking like the materials they were made of instead of flesh. At one point, when the junkie inmate was injecting himself with the reagent, I could see the tube flushing the liquid down past his arm when they tried to make it look like it was in his arm. They followed no continuity from the first two movies, making the reanimated senseless amnesiacs, unless it suited the plot, like the rat inmate being able to talk, yell, and think to be a threat to West. The only saving grace for this movie was <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001062/">Jeffrey Combs</a> himself as Herbert West. He was perfect in this role, acting just as he had in the previous two despite not having done this role in over a decade. His acting was great, his delivery perfect. It’s a shame he had planks of wood to act with</p>
