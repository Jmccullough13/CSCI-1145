  <h3><a id="summary">Summary</a></h3>
  <p>In a sorority house, someone breaks into the house while a woman, Barb, is talking on the phone. After she hangs up,someone calls the house and makes noise into the phone, spewing obscenities at the girls of the house, laughing, and ends the call by saying he’ll kill Barb. One girl, Claire, goes to pack for the holidays and is attacked in her closet while the girls are giving presents to the dorm mother. Dorm mother pulls a bottle of brandy from the toilet and drinks it. Claire is revealed to have a bag over her head. Her father is on campus looking for her and goes to a nearby fraternity house where they’re having a party for children for the holiday. Another girl, Jess, is pregnant and talks to her boyfriend about getting an abortion. The strange person answers the phone and Jess answers, screaming at them before hanging up. The girls and Claire’s father go to the police and Barb is “abrasive” towards the officer, and they don’t take the threat seriously. Another woman comes in and asks for the police to find her thirteen year old daughter who has also gone missing. Claire’s boyfriend goes to the police and demands that they take her case seriously. Barb gets drunk and yells at everyone for thinking that she drove Claire out. They make a search party to find Claire and the thirteen year old girl. Dorm mother hears the cat in the attic and sees Claire’s body before she’s attacked and impaled on a hook. The party finds the thirteen year old girl murdered. Jess arrives home and gets another weird call, so she calls the police. Jess and Peter and talk about their future. The police put together the report from Jess and the missing Claire and look into them. Detective helps them get their phone tapped so that police can listen in and looks around the house. With carolers outside, the murderer attacks Barb with a glass unicorn ornament. The call comes again, but they can’t trace it in time. Peter calls, and the detective becomes interested in him as a suspect. Phyl goes to check on Barb and is attacked. The calls are shown to be coming from inside the house, on the other line in Mrs. Mack’s line. Officer posted at the house to watch them is dead in his car. Sergeant tells her the caller is in the house and she calls for her house mates instead of leaving. Jess grabs a fire poker and checks on them to find them dead. Killer hiding behind the door, Jess hurts him and tries to flee but can’t get the door open so she hides in the basement. Peter breaks the window to the basement to get in and calls for her. Police arrive as Jess is screaming they find her with Peter dead in her lap. They determine that Peter is the one who killed the others, but as she is left alone in her bed, the camera pans to the attic, where the real killer leaves the attic. As the camera zooms out of onto the house exterior, the phone rings inside. </p>
  <h3><a id="thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <p>This movie is essentially the forerunner of all modern slasher movies, with all of the tropes, from what I researched, originating here. We have the group of people with different roles in the movie, each one unique and done overlapping. They are hunted down, one by one, and all but the main girl are stupid morons who don’t know how to survive. I see this movie in so many others that have come out since, and though I don’t like sladhers, I’m glad I got to see the parent of them, to see where it came from. The ending was pretty good, too, chilling and earned, unlike some of the “twist” endings of other slasher movies I’ve seen. My favorite character was the detective. He didn’t belittle the girls, didn’t disbelieve them, and he had genuine emotion when interacting with people. And on a final ending note, toiler brandy is disgusting…toilet brandy… </p>
