 <h4>1985</h4>
  <h3><a id="summary">Summary</a></h3>
  <p>Four people, Sarah, Billy, John, and Miguel, land their helicopter in an abandoned city. Sarah and Miguel get out to search for live people and lure in zombies by calling out on a bullhorn. They escape back to the air and return to their underground base. Sarah and John argue about refueling the chopper and they find out that one of their number, a major, had died that morning, leaving twelve of them left on the base. Sarah and Miguel join Steel and Rickles in trying to lure zombies in to capture for experimentation. Miguel drops the pole restraining the zombie they had captured out of exhaustion forcing Sarah to grab it before it gets Rickles. Sarah drugs Miguel to get him to relax and sleep. Sarah and Ted, a scientist, talk to Rhodes, the man in charge, about the continuing conditions in the base and the toll it’s taking on people, though Rhodes doesn’t care. Sarah goes to talk to Logan, the lead scientist, who has been experimenting on the zombies, trying to find a way to enslave the zombies. Sarah finds out that he’s using the corpse of the recently deceased major for his experiments. One of the zombies, who’s chained to a wall, looks upset. They all have a meeting where the military men yell at everyone else, and when Sarah moves to leave, Rhodes threatens to shoot her, then to shoot Steel when he won’t shoot Sarah. Sarah returns. Logan arrives and Rhodes flips out on him, but Logan tells him that he might be able to enslave the zombies. Rhodes gives them some time to do their work, but threatens them all if they question his command. John tells Sarah and Ted that they need to watch themselves because they aren’t necessary. Sarah and Miguel have a falling out. She goes to visit Bill and John and they discuss their purpose in the base and what they’re doing and what it means. While working in the lab the next day, Logan tells Sarah and Ted about Bub, the zombie that had been chained in his lab, and they watch him interact with a razor, seeming to remember what a razor is used for, and with a book. Sarah remarks how Bub doesn’t seem to want to try and attack Logan. Rhodes arrives and Bub speaks and salutes Rhodes. Rhodes refuses to salute back and Bub starts getting angry before Logan salutes him back. Logan hands him an empty gun and he points it at Rhodes and pulls the trigger. When nothing happens, he looks upset and looks for the clip. They go to harvest more zombies and one of the collars breaks, allowing the zombie to attack a soldier. Miguel shoots sporadically, killing another soldier, before being bitten in the arm himself and runs off. Sarah catches up to him, knocks him out, and cuts his arm off, cauterizing the wound. John and Bill help, and when Rhodes chases them down, they have a standoff, but when Sarah promises to kill Miguel herself if he turns, he backs off, but tells them that he and his remaining men won’t help them anymore. Bill and Sarah go back to the compound to get supplies to help keep Miguel alive and they find more of Logan’s experiments, including keeping one of the recently deceased soldier’s heads alive, as well as a tape of him talking to himself during his experiments. They see him interacting with Bub, putting headphones on his head and letting him listen to music. Bub grabs his arm but does nothing, instead allowing Logan to show him how to operate a tape player. For his reward, Logan gives him a bucket of entrails from the men who died. Rhodes comes in and finds out and shoots Logan before taking everyone’s guns. Rhodes tries to force John to fly them out by killing Ted and pushing Sarah and Bill into the area where they farm zombies. John tries to get him to let them out, but he refuses, telling Steel to beat him up instead. Miguel escapes out of the base, destroying the elevator controls, while Bill and Sarah are attacked by zombies and Bub finds a way to remove his chain. John knocks Rhodes out, steals his revolvers, and goes after Sarah and Bill. Up top, Miguel lets the zombies into the perimeter and down into the base while he’s being eaten, where Rhodes and his men were trying to fix the left. Rhodes takes the only cart, leaving the others stranded in the bay, and tries to flee. Bub finds the body of Logan and gets upset before seeing the guns Rhodes had taken from Sarah and Ted left behind. Steel manages to escape, but as he’s trying to shoot Bub, he gets attacked by zombies and shoots himself to avoid being eaten alive. John catches up to Bill and Sarah and they make it to a missile silo, where they crawl up and out. Bub finds Rhodes and shoots him in the shoulder and leg before he’s taken by a crowd of zombies. Before he’s torn apart, Bub shoots him in the chest and salutes him as he dies. John, Bill, and Sarah escape on the chopped, making it to an uninhabited island.</p>
  <h3><a id="thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <p>This movie was a vast improvement over Dawn of the Dead. This, I felt, was a much better psychological look at people surviving in an apocalyptic scenario, with a wide range of reactions and coping. That first zombie was amazing special effects. The shots were great, not a scene felt wasted. Tom Savini, Romero’s effects guy for all three of these movies, was on his AAA game for this movie. Everything looked amazing, especially the first zombie we see. Some of the makeup effects were still a little bland and grey, but they looked much better than in the previous film. The characters were mostly good and believable, though two of them I felt were too over the top: Steel and Rickles. They were laughing goons in the beginning, nothing but toadies to Rhodes, but once Rhodes showed his true self, Steel, at least, had some growth and felt like a true character. Rhodes as a character was great, showing his thirst for power and controlling the situation as a way of dealing with impending doom, and he wanted to keep his men, the people he cared about, alive John was deep and philosophical, but not in an overbearing way. He forced Sarah to think more about her situation and how she dealt with it. Speaking of Sarah, save for the very first scene in the movie, which was a dream, she was the best actress in the series by far. Subtle, serious when it called for it, scared, upset-her range was amazing! Logan was also over the top, but I could see how his situation would drive him insane. He was dissecting and experimenting on human bodies and no matter what he said, I didn’t feel that he was able to separate that in his mind. The ending zombie rush was so much better than the one in the last movie. I didn’t think I’d like a zombie movie more than Night of the Living Dead, but this far surpassed it. </p>
