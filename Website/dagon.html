 <h4>2001</h4>
  <h3><a id="summary">Summary</a></h3>
  <p>A man scuba diving finds a hole in the bottom of the ocean shaped like an eye and he swims into it. While investigating, he finds a mermaid, who attacks him with sharp teeth. Paul wakes up from the dream with Barbara, his wife, and they argue about the merits of enjoying life. She gets angry at him and throws his work laptop off the side of the boat they’re on. They hear chanting coming from a village they’re anchored near and a storm comes out of nowhere from over the village. The wind runs them into a rock, piercing the boat. Vicki, wife of Howard, owner of boat, gets her leg stuck between a bed and the rock that pierces the boat, and Paul and Barbara are forced to go into the village to get help. Something attacks Vicki as they get into the village, but no one is out in the streets and the windows are dark. They hear singing from a church at the top of the village and bang on the door to get help. Paul sees the eye on the door, the same eye as in his dream. The singing stops, and as they go inside, they see no one. They find a priest in the church who gets some fisherman to help them get to the boat, but Barbara has to stay to get the police. While speaking to the priest, she sees that he has webbed fingers. As she walks through the town, she sees people, but they all have their faces covered or are making strange noises. She gets to a hotel and asks the clerk to use the phone, but he and the priest attack her and knock her out. Paul makes it to the boat but finds no sign of Howard or Vicki. When he returns to the shore, the priest tells him that Barbara went to the next town to get police and to wait for her at the hotel. The clerk does not respond to him, but as he gets Paul a key, Paul sees gills in his neck. When he gets to his room, he finds nothing is working. He looks out the window and sees a large group of villagers in the street below. They notice him and start charging their way up to his room. He pries a lock off of the bathroom door to replace the one missing on the hotel door as they start to mess with the handle. They stop, and he asks if he can help them, causing them to push harder on the door and break it open. He jumps out of the window and through a skylight on the warehouse next door. He hides when the people come in to look for him, and he finds what looks like human skin hanging from hooks in the ceiling. He sees Howard’s skin and draws their attention to him, but sets fire to the building to escape while they try and save the skins. He runs into a human man on the street who calls out for help and he fights him to silence. After something crawls past them, covered in a raincoat, the man tells Paul that the people in the village kill people and take their faces and that they killed Barbara. He tells Paul that the town used to be full of fishers but they had little yield. A captain came to town and told them they’re fools to pray to a God who brings them nothing but ruin and can get them a god who brings fish. They kicked him out, but some men went with him to the shore to call a prayer to the new god, Dagon. Soon after, many fish and gold washed up into the village, and people began to destroy the iconography in the church to replace it with new icons. The gold stopped coming, and the people began to sacrifice people to Dagon. The man tells Paul that he’s the last human left in the town. The man takes Paul to the main house of the grandson of the captain and tells Paul that they have the only car on the island and that the people on the island are changing to not be able to be on land anymore. He goes to distract the guards at the house while Paul tries to steal the car. He accidentally honks the horn and flees the car into the main house. He is chased upstairs and into a room, where he runs into the mermaid, Uxia, he saw in his dream. Her father comes to the door and asks if she’s seen the human, but she tells him he’s gone. Uxia tries to seduce Paul, but when he feels gills in her abdomen and sees that her legs are tentacles, he flees, running into the chauffeur. They fight and Paul steals his keys, getting into the car as a crowd of people try to surround him and Uxia calls to him to stay and drives off. He runs into people trying to block his escape and is attacked while trying to remove one from under the car, fleeing into a nearby house. A small kid finds him and shouts for help, and a man-like creature with rows of sharp teeth and tentacle arms attacks him. He kills the thing, but draws the attention of others, who capture him in a fishing net. When he comes to, he’s in a prison cell with Barbara, the last human and Vicki, who’s lost her leg. She tells them that something pulled her under and violated her before throwing her into the cell. They try to escape when the priest comes to open their cell and immediately get surrounded and captured again. Vicki kills herself rather than be captured again, forcing them to take Barbara in her place. The priest takes Paul and the man to a room, hang them by their wrists, and cut the man’s face off. They start on Paul, but Uxia stops them, telling Paul that he’s hers. When they cut Paul down to take him to a ceremony, he kills the priest and his helpers. He takes a can of gas to the church and finds a staircase to a subterranean cavern, where Uxia is torturing Barbara before lowering her into a pit of water where Dagon waits. Paul sprays the people with gas and lights them on fire. He raises Barbara back up and she demands that he kill her rather than be brood mare to Dagon. Something jumps out of the pit, full of tentacles, and rips her off of the chains, pulling her back under. The remaining people beat Paul to the ground, where Uxia’s father stabs him but she stop him, showing him marks on Paul’s chest that indicate gills growing. They tell him that his mother had been brought to the village and that he is a child of Dagon. Paul douses himself in gas and sets himself on fire rather than be one of the people. Uxia tackles him into the pit, where the water starts to heal him and the gills fully form in his chest, allowing him to breath. He and Uxia swim down into the eye pit from his dream and into darkness.</p>
  <h3><a id="thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <p>More Lovecraft! This is nothing like the story Dagon, but has a lot of mythos elements and was actually enjoyable when I could ignore Paul’s utter stupidity. Paul is the stupidest main character I’ve ever seen in a movie, constantly making the dumbest and worst decisions that a person could make, but rather than be a coward and hide or run, he actually leans into everything happening, trying to get out of it, one dumb decision at a time, such as when he tried to hotwire a car, set off the horn, and ran into the house of the main priest instead of locking himself in the car. He fights whenever he can, flees only when the odds are against him, and tries to do what he can to stay alive. He’s a dumbass, but he consistently tries to get out of his situation and make it better. I can give him respect for that, at least. He reminds me of Ash from <u><a href="evil-dead.html">The Evil Dead</a></u> in that respect. The set pieces and props were amazing, all except the priestess hat Uxia had on at the end, which looked like bad papier mache. So much attention was paid to detail, and only two shots were in CG, the rest was practical effects. Attention to detail was good, too, and I can tell this was made by a fan of the mythos. Paul even had on a Miskatonic college shirt, which is the school that constantly shows up in Lovecraft stories. My biggest complaint, aside from Paul’s stupid decisions, is the chanting the people constantly did, which was “Ia! Ia! Cthulhu Fthagn!” This is a line from “Call of Cthulhu” and only used there, but people are constantly using it in other Lovecraft stories, even though it’s a prayer to Cthulhu himself and no one else. Overall, though, fun movie. </p>
