 <h4>1968</h4>
  <h3><a id="summary">Summary</a></h3>
  <p>Brother and sister Johnny and Barbra drive into a cemetery to place flowers on a grave. The radio station comes on to say they were back after technical difficulties. As the two lay the flowers, they see a dirty man with torn clothes wandering through the cemetery. He moves towards them, wrestles the brother to the ground and hits his head on a tombstone. She makes it to the car and is trapped when the man attacks the car and breaks window with rock. Barbra, when realizing that Johnny had the keys in his coat, coasts the car downhill to get away from the man and crashes. She flees the car and hides in a nearby a farmhouse as more people join the first man. A man, Ben, in a truck arrives and joins her in the house. While Barbra is freaking out, Ben tries to board up the house. The people outside destroy the headlights on the car and Ben goes out to take care of them with a tire iron. A fourth person comes in the back and is impaled by the tire iron. A fifth one shows up and is beaten back to reveal many more coming to the house. The impaled man has a hole in his head but his eyes are still moving somehow. Ben sets the man on fire and throws his body out of the house. Ben and Barbra board up the house and share what they had been doing before they got to the house. They get into an argument about getting her brother and she faints. Ben turns on the radio and the station says that people are being murdered en masse around the eastern seaboard of the US. The murderers are normal looking people seeming to be in a daze. Ben douses a chair in lighter fluid, sets it on fire, and kicks it out the door to try and drive off the people around the house. Barb wakes up after Ben’s finished boarding up the house. The radio reveals that victims are being eaten by their attackers. Two men who had been hiding in the basement, Tom and Harry, come up, and they start arguing that the basement is the safest place, that the things are too strong for them. Ghouls reach in through the window and Tom cuts its fingers off. Another gets shot in the chest twice and acts as if nothing has happened before being shot in the head. The shots attract a lot more of them, including ones who are very obviously dead. Harry boards himself in the basement with his wife and daughter. Daughter is injured and feeling sick. Harry’s wife, Helen, argues that they should join the others to watch the TV and find out what’s going on. The TV says that people who die come back to attack others and that a satellite that had been launched toward Venus had picked up a large amount of radiation and exploded and is causing the dead to rise. Bodies must be burned immediately upon death. The group decides to try and distract the zombies with Molotov cocktails while gassing a truck to escape, but they spill gas on the truck and set it on fire, exploding with Tom and Judy, Tom’s girlfriend. Harry refuses to let Ben back, prompting Ben to force his way in and attack Harry. The group watches a report about a police-led militia group that’s going around the area and killing “ghouls”. The ghouls then attack the house in a large group and Harry tries to take the gun from Ben, but Ben shoots him and he falls into the basement. Barb rallies and saves Helen from the ghouls trying to break in, but Helen dies from her newly turned daughter after crashing down into the basement. A dead Johnny shows up and takes Barbra from the house. Ghouls break in and force Ben down into the basement, just as Harry had wanted. Ghouls swarm up against the wall, pounding on it to get to Ben. In the morning, Ghouls start to lose interest and wander away. A militia group arrives at the house and start killing the ghouls but also shoot Ben.</p>
  <h3><a id="thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <p>Truth time: I’ve seen five of the movies on this list already, so I’m kind of cheating, but for two of them it’s been so long that I barely remember them. This movie is the first of the three. I saw this movie when I was ten, and I can’t for the life of me figure out why I haven’t watched it again. I was so excited for this movie! The action scenes and fights aren’t great, obviously fake with punches clearly going to the side of an actor’s head, but still well shot. Ben is a great survivor character, smart and realistic about their situation. I think I’ve been subconsciously basing any zombie survival knowledge on his actions. Barbra is great at acting shellshocked, too. I like how they drew out the survival set up instead of expositing what’s going on. They set up what’s going on in the outside word through exposition, but in a believable, if cliché, way, and they didn’t just focus on it, but played it in the background on the radio while other actions were taking place in the foreground. I lobve the juxtaposition of the TV revealing that the victims were “partially devoured by their murderer”, and immediately we’re shown a woman missing a face at the top of the stairs. My biggest complaint is one echoed through the annals of zombie history: Why did the first one ignore Johnny and chase Barbra? He had a meal right there! Yes, it was for plot convenience to hide the nature of the zombie, but still puzzling. I found the infighting and arguing in the group realistic. This movie is a masterpiece, despite its flaws</p>
