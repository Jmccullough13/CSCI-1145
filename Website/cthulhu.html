  <h3><a id="summary">Summary</a></h3>
  <p>Russel gets a call early in the morning about his mother dying and he’s returning home for her funeral. While driving home, he hears news reports about the polar regions being crucial to the survival of humanity and the last polar bear died. He arrives too late to the funeral but is able to speak to his father, sister, and family lawyer, who tells him that they’re selling his childhood home. Russel’s dad tries to talk to him, but he avoids the talk. He instead takes a walk along a deserted storefront and into an abandoned warehouse, where he sees names written on the floor, including his own. He sees a parade of cloaked people walking into the warehouse and escapes in a longboat, desperate to avoid them. He meets with an old friend, Mike, and they reminisce about old times. He has a dream where his father is berating him while wearing a purple suit before he visits a crash where the dying driver coughs up a black stone and gives it to him. He jolts awake and finds the stone on his chest. He goes to visit his grandmother in a retirement home who tells him that his mother left something for him at the house in the basement, but then she tells him not to go to the house, she asks about his mother, then tells him that his father told him she died. She tells him not to be a stranger, then tells him that no one will ever save him. Russel has dinner with his family and his father berates him for being gay. Russel demands that his father, who is the priest of a religion that worships the Old Ones, have a meal, without bringing up religion. His sister begs him to stay longer than a few days because no one knows him and they want to know him better. He has drinks with Mike in a bar and Russel shows him the rock he found. A sailor sees the rock and tells them a story about how he found some stone idol that looks like a baby, but he leaves before he can finish the story. Russel’s sister walks in with a friend who knew Russel from school, but leaves, and Mike leaves to go to work, leaving Russel alone with the friend, Susan. She tells him that her husband has books about the rock Russel has and invites him over to find them. When he leaves, Russel is ambushed by the sailor who aggressively demands liquor and beer for answers about the rock. He gets the booze and the cashier tells him not to talk to the sailor, which he ignores, bringing the booze to the sailor. The sailor tells him that his grandmother told him about an island with a ruined city, and that years earlier some kids, names that match the ones on the warehouse floor, disappeared when a gathering of inhuman creatures met in the city. His uncle tried to stop them, but died amongst many of others. He tells Russel about shoggoths, which come from the sea and leads others back into the sea. He stops when he hears something out at sea and sends Russel away. Russel finds the cashier from the liquor store, Julia, and demands answers from her. While he’s driving her home, they see something bright float across the road. He gets out to investigate what it was, but Julia freaks out and demands that he get back in the car. They arrive at her home and she runs out, but comes back tearfully and hands him a picture of her little brother, who she said was taken five years previously by the things and begs him to find him. The next day, he meets Susan at her job as a zookeeper. She leads him to her home, where he meets her husband, and when he asks about the book, she leads him to her bedroom and asks him to give her a baby because her husband is infertile, but he turns her down and tries to get the book out of him, but he also tries to get him to sleep with her, offering him money to sleep with her, but he passes out after they drug him and Susan rapes him. Later, he tells Mike about the names in the warehouse, how they’re a list of the people that his father’s cult has killed, but when he goes to check them again, they’re gone. Instead, he finds a stone orb on a pedestal that resembles the rock and a wall of shimmering air around it. A man comes out of the wall, causing Russel to flee the warehouse and into a neighborhood. He finds a house with a boy who lets him in to use the phone. The boy tells him that they live in the basement of the house and they’re waiting for Cthulhu. Russel recognizes him as the boy from the picture that Julia gave him, but the boy denies it. Something starts pounding on the door and the boy leads Russel into the basement, a winding, ruinous place, and Russel gets separated from him. Using a disposable camera as a light source, he tries to find his way out of the basement as flees when he sees baby-like creatures crawling after him. He climbs up a ladder and comes out of a sewer hole near the docks. He goes to Mike’s to unwind and tries to rationalize what happened and what he saw. Mike agrees to help him find the boy, but when they go back to the house, they find the boy dead and tied to deck railing. While driving through town, he drives into the middle of a parade and the sailor runs in front of him. He tries to chase him down, but loses him in the crowd. He goes to an auction to try and buy his grandmother’s house but is outbid, and when he tries to talk to the person who outbid him, he’s arrested for the murder of the child. They demand to know what the child told him before one of them punch him out. He has another dream where he sees people trapped in a large wooden box before waking in a jail cell. Outside, he hears sirens warbling and sees a face that terrifies him at his window He runs to the door and tries to hold it closed while something tries to get in, and an arm breaks through the window, pale and fleshy. He passes out, and in the morning, he finds the cell unlocked. The station is ransacked and in shambles, and he leaves, wandering deserted streets. He finds Susan and demands answers from her, but her husband knocks him out. He awakes to something trying to pull him through a doorway. He leaves and goes to his mother’s house, where he finds a TV with a tape from his mother. She tells him that she had tried to drive him away from the town to keep him safe, because men of his line disappear when their grandchildren are born, back to the sea to dwell with Cthulhu. He leaves the house, terrified, and is attacked by the man from the shimmery wall. Russel attacks him and beats him down. Every phone rings in every house in the town, emitting messages for everyone to stay inside because of rioting through the town and surrounding counties. Russel finds Mike and they agree to leave after getting Mike’s daughter. While driving through the highways, they come across rioters and people in the streets, some of them trying to shoot their car. They arrive at Russel’s father house, where they see his father gun down police who try and take him away. Russel is taken into the house at gunpoint where he begs his sister not to go into the ocean, but she tells him they’re coming onto land to get them. They show him his “children”, something in a bathtub, that causes him to flee, looking for Mike, but instead he finds a shoreline filled with wheat. He sees figures come out of the ocean and his father demands that he sacrifice Mike to his new god, giving Russel the stone. Russel lifts the stone and screams.</p>
  <h3><a id="thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <p>This movie had exactly one good thing about it: a background shot of a sign that read “Esoteric order of <a href="dagon.html" title="A much better movie">Dagon</a>”. Everything else was awful. The camera quality was crap, seemingly shot on a home video camera instead of something professional. The acting was bad from everyone but Russel, who was the focus of the movie and we never saw much of anyone else, so that was ok. The plot was nonsensical at the best of times, broken and disjointed with little cohesion between scenes. Some scenes have something to do with other scenes, but they’re never in sequence. It’s filled with flashbacks that mean relatively nothing to the overall plot and flashes of scenes that also mean nothing. It took forty minutes to finally get to the point of the movie. Everything before that was humdrum life sprinkled with bits of Mythos, but not nearly enough. This movie is like a toddler telling a story, rambling and all over the place, getting to the point infrequently. On top of all of that, there was an assault scene, which was incredibly uncomfortable. This wanted to a melodramatic Oscar worthy movie, deep and philosophical, but it was mush and pointless nothing. Russel, despite being a decent actor, was one of the worst parts of this movie. Why did he not immediately leave? We all could have been spared some time if he had… </p>
