 <h4>1969</h4>
  <h3><a id="summary">Summary</a></h3>
  <p>The movie starts with a tribal dance and the crucifixion of a prisoner in an African jungle. A man, Julian, comes in and stops the ritual, exclaiming at the man, Edward. Some time later in a manor in England, Edward is trying to break out of a locked room, and Julian and a servant push him back in and manacle his ankle. Two men, Trench and Mark, enter an inn and speak to a man who is completing a tonic for them. Trench comes to talk to Julian about Edward and his downward trending behavior. He goes to see Edward and they speak about breaking Edward out of his confinement. Trench and the witch doctor from the inn arrive at the manor and deliver something to Edward. Edward is found seemingly dead the next morning and is placed into a coffin. Julian reveals that he knows that Trench was embezzling funds from him and blackmails Trench into finding a replacement body for the funeral so that they don’t have to show his face. Trench and Mark lure an inn owner in with money, kill him with poison to use as a body double for Edward, and bring him to Julian. Julien performs the funeral and as Trench and Mark dispose of the body, Julian flashes back on why Edward was taken prisoner: he ran down and killed a child on a plantation in Africa. They bury the coffin, but graverobbers dig it up and bring it to a doctor who uses bodies for medical research. The doctor sees Edward’s face and pauses, allowing Edward to try and strangle him. Edward doesn’t kill the doctor and forces him to house Edward instead, wearing a red hood to hide his face. Mark tries to leave England but is ambushed and killed by Edward. Edward appears at the manor to retrieve some money and is seen by Elizabeth. The servants are sent after him but he escapes. At the doctor’s house, he enjoys the maid’s company, whom the doctor immediately fires. She starts to work for Julian instead. Edward is forced into an inn by drunkards and pays a prostitute but is ambushed by one of the drunkards and the prostitute. He shows them his face and murders them both. Cops show up and find a cloak left behind and use it to track Edward to the doctor’s, but the doctor gets them to go away. Julian finds out that Edward was still alive when he was buried. Edward confronts Trench to find out where the witch doctor was and kills Trench, though he’s seen by Trench’s wife. Edward goes after the witch doctor and demands that he fix his face. They revisit the reason for his disfiguration and discover that Julian was the one who had run down the child. Edward is stabbed and he burns the witch doctor after being stabbed. Edward kills the doctor after being patched up and goes to hunt down Julian. Julian finds out that Edward is at the doctor’s and goes to find Edward. Edward drags the maid from the home and Julian and Elizabeth give chase. Edward bites Julian and Julian is forced to shoot his brother. Edward is buried alive again and Julian, now locked away in the manor, is now horribly disfigured, just as Edward had been</p>
  <h3><a id="thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <p>This movie started off…uncomfortably racist…Lots of black men and women dancing around in tribal garb. The priest’s twitchy acting physically hurt me. I’m sure it was supposed to be horror discomfort, but…This movie had better camera quality and lighting than previous <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001637/">Vincent Price</a> movies. The transitions are weird, though: sometimes there are fades, sometimes direct cuts, sometimes bad grainy shots that don’t match the quality of the rest of the footage. The acting wasn’t good from anyone. <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000489/">Christopher Lee</a> seemed to be barely trying in the handful of scenes he was in, and Vincent was barely in it, but when he was, he didn’t seem to be trying hard. The makeup on Edward at the end was awful. He looked like a discount Phantom of the Opera</p>
