  <h4>1961</h4>
  <h3><a id="summary">Summary</a></h3>
  <p>Francis Barnard visits the castle of his brother-in-law Nicholas Medina to find out why his sister Elizabeth has suddenly disappeared. Nicholas and his sister Catherine originally state that Elizabeth died from a rare blood disorder six months earlier, but when pressed, Nicholas is evasive. Francis again asks about his sister's death when the family physician, Dr. Leon, arrives to check on Nicholas. Dr. Leon tells him that his sister died of heart failure. When Francis demands to see where she died, Nicholas takes him to a torture chamber in the basement of the castle, used by his father as part of the inquisition. Elizabeth was obsessed with the chamber's torture devices because of the castle’s atmosphere and died after locking herself in an iron maiden. Francis doesn’t believe it and says that Nicholas seems extremely guilty about Elizabeth’s death, and Catherine tells him how he watched their father kill his mother and uncle for infidelity after sneaking down to the dungeon. Dr. Leon tells them that Nicholas’ mother was not killed outright, but was entombed behind a brick wall alive and that Nicholas is terrified that he had accidentally done the same to Elizabeth, though he assures all that he personally verified Elizabeth’s death. When Elizabeth’s old room is destroyed despite being locked and her favorite harpsichord is played in the night, Nicholas thinks that she is haunting the castle, but after Francis finds a secret passage from Nicholas’ room to Elizabeth, he accuses him of creating a hoax and demands to see Elizabeth’s coffin. When they break down the wall and open it, they find a corpse that seems to have tried to scratch its way out of the coffin, as though it had been buried alive. That night, as he is near to a breakdown, Nicholas hears Elizabeth calling him. He follows her voice to her tomb, where she rises from the coffin and chases him into the torture chamber. He passes out and Elizabeth reveals that she is still alive and that this was a plot to steal his fortune and castle from her and her lover, Dr. Leon. Nicholas awakes and, completely broken, believes himself to be his father, and Elizabeth and Leon his mother and uncle. He replays the events that he had seen as a child, beating Elizabeth and locking her in the iron maiden. When Dr. Leon tried to stop him, they struggle and Nicholas throws him into the pit of the dungeon, killing him instantly. Francis hears Elizabeth's screams and enters the dungeon, where Nicholas thinks he is also Nicholas’ uncle and knocks him out. When he comes to, he is strapped to a table with a bladed pendulum hovering over it, which Nicholas causes to drop nearer with every swing. Catherine and a servant arrive and manage to stop the pendulum before it can slice into Francis’ stomach, causing Nicholas to fall to his death in the pit. As they leave, Catherine promises to block the dungeon off, though as they exit the dungeon, Elizabeth is revealed to still be alive in the iron maiden.</p>
  <h3><a id="thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <p>Overacting and chewing the scenery for all! Very loosely based on the story by Poe, a man gone mad by people close to him setting out to destroy his mind. Very bad and wooden acting from all but <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001637/">Vincent Price</a> and the actress playing his “deceased” wife. The scene where she emerged from the coffin was actually scary, but the only creepy part. The other “scares” in this movie mostly came from the weird camera angles with bright color overlaid on the entire scene and zooming in dramatically. There was some decent tension in the middle, but it devolved into “actiony” sequences with a badly choreographed fight scene at the end. Vincent was also “pac-manning” his way through the scenery at the end, which was a shame. He was very subtle in <u><a href="fly-1958.html">The Fly</a></u> and earlier in this movie.</p>
