  <h4>1963</h4>
  <h3><a id="summary">Summary</a></h3>
  <p>Hill House, a house constructed by Hugh Crain as a home for his wife, had a long and horrifying history. The wife died when her carriage crashed against a tree as she was coming to the house for the first time. Crain’s second wife died falling down the stairs. Crain's daughter Abigail lived in the house for the rest of her life, staying in her nursery room for the rest of her life. She died old, calling for her companion who looked after her. The companion inherited the house next, but hanged herself from a spiral staircase in the library. Hill House passed into the hands of a relative, though no one lived in it after the companion died. Dr. John Markway wants to study the activity at Hill House and invites a number of seemingly random people to stay in the house for a time to help him. Eleanor Lance spent most of her life watching after her mother, and when she died, she went to live with her sister and her family, though they belittle and insult her. She accepts the invitation and goes to the house against her sister’s wishes. When there, she meets Theodora, the only other person to accept the invitation, and Luke, the owner’s son. Markway reveals that he had invited them after researching psychic phenomena inn their past: Theo could display some psychic ability and Nell had poltergeist activity in her youth, resulting in a rain of boulders for days near her house. During their first night in the house, Nell and Theo hear banging on the walls and the voice of a girl laughing. Markway and Luke heard nothing, having found a dog and chased it before it disappeared. Eleanor begins to feel a bond with Hill House. The next day, the team explores the house, discovering a cold spot outside the nursery room, which is the heart of the house. That night, more loud banging occurs, and the next day, they find "Help Eleanor Come Home" written on the wall in chalk. Theo moves into Nell's room and they fall asleep in the same bed. Nell wakes up to hear voices and thinks that Theo is gripping her hand tightly with fear, only for Theo to rise from a nearby couch, revealing Nell to be alone on the bed. The next day Dr. Markway's wife Grace arrives at Hill House to get Markway to stop the investigation. She decides to join the group and stubbornly moves into the nursery to sleep. That night, the group sleeps in the parlor and the banging happens again, louder than before. It tires to get into the parlor, then moves to the nursery instead. When they go to check on Grace, she’s gone. Nell starts to lose her grip on sanity and starts to talk to statues in the house. She climbs the spiral stairwell, which is very loose, is chased up by Markway, and sees Grace at the top. Markway sends her home, scared by her obsession with the house. Nell agrees and drives off, but as she nears the gate, the wheel starts to turn itself and she thinks that the house is calling her back. She crashes into a tree after seeing Grace run past and dies. Markway notes that the tree is the same one that the first wife had died on.</p>
  <h3><a id="thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <p>As the movie began, I was assaulted by brass and flutes that played too happily and clashed with the tone of a main character who was miserable and a narration of a haunted house’s history. The music did get better, darker and moodier as the movie went on, but at no point was this movie cheerful enough to warrant the joyful sounds at the beginning. Nell was hard to get behind at first, with an inner monologue about never returning home after going to the house and setting up an imaginary life for herself. She had many inner monologues throughout the movie, and almost every one took me out of whatever was happening. I’m a firm believer in show don’t tell, so it grated on me every time they happened. Thankfully, as the movie went on, her acting became a lot more focused on showing and the monologues mostly stopped until the very end. The next to final scene in the library was also suitably tense, teasing us with “is she going to fall or not?” but it felt too slow and halting compared to the fast movement of the previous horror scene, cutting back and forth between her and the doctor. The movie took a while to hit its stride, but once it did, it went full force. The night scenes in the house were perfectly tense, scary, and had me paying complete attention to what was happening, the third night in particular. The acting was very good, but too much negativity thrown around in one scene only for those same characters to be chummy and happy the next. Horror nicely relied on mood and atmosphere, not just on the actual scary events in the movie.</p>
