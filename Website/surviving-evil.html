 <h4>2009</h4>
  <h3><a id="summary">Summary</a></h3>
  <p>A remote Philippines on the Mayaman island is attacked by creatures with long claws, slaughtering everyone in the village. A boat brings a filming crew for a wilderness survival show to the island and set up camp, filming the star of the show, Seb, building the camp grounds to make the show look more authentic. That night, while preparing for the next day, their wildlife expert, Chill, sees someone in the trees before they disappear. While filming the next day, their liaison to the tribes, Joey, yells at Chill for wandering around on her own and demands that they never travel unaccompanied on the island. Chill brings up the person she saw and Joey shrugs it off, though he gets irritated when she brings up a mythological creature supposedly on the island. While reviewing some of the filming, Phoebe, their sound designer, and Dex, the camera man, see something in the back of a shot that looks like a person in the trees. Rachel, the producer, sees a human hand partially chewed fall out of a tree nearby while going to relieve herself. Joey and Chill go to the village to make introductions and get ready for the village shots and find it deserted. Phoebe tells Rachel that she fears she might be pregnant. Joey finds corpses in the houses and Chill finds some wrapped in the canopies between huts. Chill wants to tell the others, but Joey doesn’t want to. He tells her he has something he has to do on this island and to wait for his say so to let the others know. That night, they hear strange noises in the treetops and try to call to their home studio to get evac, but Seb and Dex tell them that they wouldn’t send help and insist on finishing the shoot. Chill and Joey talk again about the creatures, the Aswang, and tell Phoebe that they’re supposedly shapeshifting spirits that live in the trees and that the blood of pregnant women draw them out because they change the baby into one of them. Phoebe tells Chill that she might be pregnant and wants to know whether she should be scared or happy. Joey and Chill go into the jungle again to look more for the tribe and when Chill asks who she’s safer with, Joey doing something shady or the crew with a pregnant woman, and Joey looks panicked. The others start a shoot and Seb creates a bow to use for hunting. Chill tells Joey she wants to go back and protect the others because of what’s on the island, but Joey says he’s looking for them. They find an abandoned tower and Joey takes some dynamite from his bag, telling Chill that his grandfather was a prisoner on the island during WWII and was forced to bury bags of gold on this island and that he’s there to find the gold to help his sick daughter. Phoebe sees something in a tree on the beach. She pokes it with a stick and a bloody baby falls out of it. Seb is climbing a “sacred” tree, something he wanted to do on this island, and while he’s at the top, something takes a chunk out of his arm. Rachel tries to bind it while Dex carries Phoebe back to camp. They try to call back to the mainland for evac again, but find that the only phone was taken by Joey. Joey finds the gold buried in crates under the tower and while he’s bagging it up, Aswang arrive at the tower and try to attack Chill. She escapes from them, but when Joey tried to climb back up out of the hole under the tower, he gets eaten. Phoebe tells the others about the Aswang and that she’s the reason that the Aswang are there. They try to make plans to stay safe from the creatures, building up a large fire, but they hear Chill calling for help. Dex goes to help her and is attacked, and Seb shoots it with his bow, killing it. At the camp, they’re attacked by a pack of Aswang, but they kill and drive them off. They get to the beach and find a pack of wild dogs waiting, the Aswang in disguise, and Dex leads them away from the group, getting killed as the others get away. Chill leads them back to the tower to get them underground until the boat comes back for them. While on the way, Seb, losing blood, trips and knocks himself and Phoebe down a hill. Seb gets stabbed by his own machete and tells Phoebe to leave. She flees before several Aswang show up and kill Seb, though not before he kills a few of them. Rachel and Chill arrive at the tower and find Joey’s gun, which Rachel uses to ward the Aswang off. Rachel tries to climb into the hole that Joey made in the bottom of the tower, but the beam supporting the rope breaks and she falls to the bottom, dying. A flying Aswang swoops down and grabs Chill, but not before she grabs the dynamite that Joey had with him. She is taken into the Aswang nest and blows herself and the Aswang in the nest up. Phoebe arrives on the beach and finds the raft they had meant to escape in, casting off into the ocean with it. She washes up on shore on another island and is taken to an infirmary, where every woman there is pregnant, which freaks her out. </p>
  <h3><a id="thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <p>I’m dizzy from terrible camera shots! This movie would be passable, if not for the constant cuts, often of the same action or scene, the repetitive zoom ins and outs, and nonstop cutting from one scene to another, just to go back to the same action from before, in progress. The movie would never stick with just one scene, it had to move between two or more scenes instead of wrapping one up before moving back to the other. Once the monsters attacked, I think the longest camera shot was about 1.3 seconds. The acting was passable, including the ever great <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000708/">Billy Zane</a> and the actress who played <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0413238/">Juno</a> in <li><a href="descent.html">The Descent</a></li>, who were the best parts of this movie, though the lines that they had to speak were terrible. The music was generic nothing. The monsters, apparently some kind of Philippine vampire, were just people in red suits made to look wet with bad masks that never moved. Throughout the first half of the movie, there were constant shots of claws in the trees, but never any shots of the monsters, until one attacked and suddenly there’s a never-ending onslaught of them. If they were there, why didn’t they just always attack? Why wait for three days before suddenly attacking? They were shown to be on the island, moving in the trees, so why were they doing nothing?! This movie started out decently, and the cast had enough chemistry to make me believe that they could have been coworkers on friendly terms, but once the action started, the film promptly fell flat on its own machete.</p>
