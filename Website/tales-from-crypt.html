  <h3><a id="summary">Summary</a></h3>
  <p>A group is touring a set of catacombs in England and five of them lose the rest of the group. They come to a dead end when a door opens nearby and they all enter. The door closes behind them and a man appears, commanding them to sit. He asks them why they came on the door and a woman in the group answers that she had just felt that she had to. The first vignette starts with a Christmas scene. A man, Richard, places presents under a tree and sits down to read the paper when the woman, Joanne, beats him over the with a fire poker. An alert comes on the radio that a madman has escaped from an asylum and may be dressed in a Santa suit. She goes to lock the door and hears someone outside, and when she looks, it’s a man in a Santa suit. He tries to grab her when she goes to lock the back gate, but she gets away. She takes the body to make it look like he fell down the stairs and cleans up after the body. She goes to call the police and finds her daughter, Carole, is out of bed and has let the man in the Santa suit inside. He lunges after her and strangles her when it cuts back to the tomb. The second person, Carl, says that he was on his way home to see his family. The second vignette starts with Carl telling his wife he had to go leave for an overnight drive to make an appointment. He tells his kids and wife goodbye and leaves to go to an apartment where he meets another woman. They leave together and he falls asleep in the car, waking to scream out “No!” They run off of the road and crash into a tree. Carl is thrown from the car and crawls back to the burning corpse to find Susan but sees no trace of her. He then goes to a nearby road to get help, but everyone runs away from him. He tries top go home but finds his wife screams at him. He goes to the apartment where Susan is and she tells him that he was killed two years previously. He screams and wakes again in the car, only to crash again. Back in the tomb, the third person , James, accuses the man in the robe of trying to play a bad joke on them. The third vignette starts with several children leaving from a visit with a friendly older man. James complains about his father living across the street from the man and how he’s ruining the value of the neighborhood. He tears up the neighbor’s garden to blame it on the old man’s dogs. His dogs are taken away, leaving him upset and turning to a Ouija board to ask his dead wife for help. James convinces a city councilman to have the old man’s retirement pay taken away and turns to the kids’ parents to keep the kids away from the old man. James then conspires to send fake insulting cards to the man to try and drive him away and make him sell his home. A week later, James goes into the old man’s house to find he hanged himself. One year later, Grimsdyke rises from his grave and goes after James and rips his heart out, leaving a poem behind. The fourth vignette starts with the fourth person, Ralph, losing all of his money and has to sell property to pay back debts. He and his wife, Enid, find a statue that claims to grant three wishes and Enid wishes for a lot of money. His lawyer calls him to his office, and as he drives there, he is followed by a motorcyclist wearing a skull mask. The lawyer is called and told that Ralph was killed in a car crash. Enid gets a lot of money from life insurance and gets upset because of her wish. The lawyer tells her not to wish for Ralph back because of what happened in “The Monkey’s Paw”. She ignores it and wishes him back from before the accident and someone starts knocking on the door. Undertakers bring in Ralph’s coffin, but he had died of a heart attack, so he’s still dead, but not mangled. Enid sends the lawyer away and wishes that he was alive and always alive, but his body’s been filled with embalming fluid so he’s in constant pain. She tries to hack him apart with a sword but he can’t die, so every part of him is still alive and in pain. Back in the tomb, the fifth person demands to know what’s going on and says he doesn’t care about any warnings the robed man gives them. The fifth vignette starts with a superintendent, William, starting work in a home for the blind. He introduces himself to the patients in the cafeteria. He cuts the budget on heating and necessities in the hospital to fund his own lavish lifestyle, and when a patient tries to ask him about the situation, he dismisses the patient’s concerns as trivial. The patients eat thin and disgusting soup while William eats steak. When a patient dies, the other patients pool some meat to lure William’s dog away from him so that they can mutiny against William. They force him into a room in the basement and after several days, release him and his dog into a small maze lined with razor blades. When the dog attacks him, they turn off the lights so he can’t see in the razor blade hallway. Back in the tomb, the robed man reveals that these are all that has already happened to these people and they had already died without repentance.</p>

   <p>Another anthology movie. I generally like anthology movies, as they give a chance to show many stories that can be executed better when there’s less time to spend on the story. The acting was all over the place, though mostly was meh. The characters were kind of stupid (why would they all walk through a door that opens on its own in a tomb?!) and the only one that I enjoyed was Grimsdyke, the victim old man in the middle vignette. He was played by Peter Cushing, so he was far and away the best actor. Four of the five main characters were immoral jerks who deserved everything they got, but the last one, Ralph, didn’t do anything himself to deserve what happened. Joanne probably should have been arrested, but it was poetic for her daughter to be the death of her. Carl deserved so much more for being so willing to abandon his children so easily. James was by far the worst, tormenting an innocent man for nothing more than property value. A zombie tearing his heart out was too light for him. He should have died slowly under a steam roller. The fifth vignette was just Monkey’s paw retelling, but more graphic, though I enjoyed how they tried to avoid the mistakes from the story and made all new ones, though it came with a plot hole. If he couldn’t die, why was he in the tomb?</p>
