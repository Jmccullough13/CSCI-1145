 <h4>2005</h4>
  <h3><a id="summary">Summary</a></h3>
  <p>A group of friends, Sarah, Juno, and Beth are river rafting. Sarah’s family comes to get her, and as they’re driving home, they run into another car, and pipes from the car pierce through the car. She wakes up in the hospital and is told that her husband and daughter are dead. The three go to North Carolina to meet with Becca and Sam for a rock climbing excursion to help Sarah take her mind off of her tragedy. They meet with Holly, who’s been hired to teach them how to cave dive. Becca tells them that the caves are level two and very safe. When they arrive, Juno puts a guide to the caves back into the car. They drop into the cave system and crawl through smaller caves until they reach a large cavern where, after hearing her daughter’s laugh, Sarah climbs down to the bottom and finds a shaft going further down. Holly leads the group, crawling through smaller caves to find the way to the next cavern. Sarah gets stuck and starts to hyperventilate. Part of the tunnel starts to collapse and Sarah and Beth get out. They ask Juno for the book to the cave to find the way out and Juno tells them that she left the book in the cave because this is a new cave system that no one’s discovered. She and Beth argue while Sarah hears something. They find a tunnel, though part of it has collapsed into an abyss, but they climb across using ropes and pitons that they find in the rock already. They find cave drawings that show the caves having a different exit than the one they took in. As they move on, something with fangs growls and drools nearby. Juno finds a cave with wind blowing in it and Holly runs ahead, thinking she sees daylight. She slides down a tunnel and breaks her leg. The others find her and set her leg while Sarah hears a noise and sees a man-like creature drinking water in the tunnel ahead of them. When she tries to tell the others, they refuse to believe her and move on. They reach a cavern filled with animal bones and the creature from before attacks them. They run off and run right into another one, an eyeless face with fangs, that attacks and rips out Holly’s throat. Juno is attacked by another one while Holly is dragged off and kills it, turning to swipe at something else coming up behind her and jamming a pick through Beth’s neck. Becca, Sam, and Sarah are separated from the others in the attack. Sarah falls, hits her head, and wakes up in a room filled with human bones. Sam and Becca try and hide along a shelf from the creatures, but one catches up to them. They evade detection by being completely still, and it leaves when it hears Juno calling. Sarah finds some scraps of cloth and makes a torch before trying to find the others. One of the creatures corners Becca and Sam, but Juno kills it. Sam, using doctor’s training to identify try and figure out what the creatures are, that they hunt through sound. Juno theorizes that they hunt on the surface and bring prey back down, so there has to be an entrance out, but she won’t leave without Sarah. Sarah finds Beth, who tells her that Juno attacked her and that Juno’s lucky charm necklace came from Sarah’s husband, who was having an affair with her. Beth asks Sarah to kill her to end her pain, and Sarah smashes her head with a rock. A small creature jumps on her back and attacks her. Sarah smashes it against a rock, but its mother comes searching for it and chases Sarah down. Sarah kills her and another one when it attacks her and screams at the ceiling. Becca tries to get Juno to give up on Sarah but when she tries to go looking, she finds a large group of the creatures, forcing her to chase after Becca and Sam. Sam finds the tunnel above the abyss from before and tries to climb across but is attacked by a creature. Another comes up behind Becca and Juno and grabs Becca, tearing into her while another attacks Juno. She jumps with it down into the chasm below, landing in water, and kills the creature before trying to climb back up and out of the chasm. She tries to reach a tunnel and is about to slip when Sarah grabs her and pulls her back in, asking about the others. She asks about Beth, but Juno says she didn’t make it, and Sarah doesn’t press or accuse her. They run into a group of creatures and fight them off and Sarah confronts Juno about the lucky charm before stabbing her in the leg with a pick and running off, leaving Juno to the mercy of the creatures. Sarah slips down a hole into another boneyard and finds sunlight above her. She crawls up and out onto the side of the mountain, running back down to where they had parked the cars. She drives off before stopping and having a breakdown. She turns to see Juno in the passenger side of the car and screams, awaking back in the cave.</p>
  <h3><a id="thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <p>Why start with a death, especially of a child? It has almost nothing to do with this movie except to use Sarah as an excuse for the events to kick off. It couldn’t just be a fun excursion? The thing with Juno couldn’t have been due to a divorce? Did the thing with Juno need to happen? She already got them lost, did she need to have more blame put on her? The cuts between scenes and in action scenes were abominable, too jumpy to tell what was going on. The effects were all over the place, with decent practical effects for the creature costumes, but when it came time to fighting them, they exploded like jello. The lighting was good, especially for the ominous setting and scenery of the caves. The acting was decent for what it was, but I felt that the action acting was too forced and choreographed to feel real or genuine. The creatures were decent too, but the appearances didn’t stay the same, with the close ups showing them having wide eyes and sunken sockets, all pale, but the far shots showing them having black streaks coming out of their narrowed eyes which aren’t shown in the close ups. I understand that the unedited version makes it seem that Sarah had a psychotic break and killed all of her friends, but I got nothing of that from this version.</p>
