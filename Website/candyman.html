 <h4>1992</h4>
  <h3><a id="summary">Summary</a></h3>
  <p>A college student tells a woman, Helen, the story of a babysitter who brings a boy over to the house she was sitting at and tells him the legend of Candyman, who appears behind you when you look in a mirror and say his name five times. He said it four times, and she sent him downstairs before saying it a fifth time. A man in a fur coat with a hook hand appeared behind her, and down in the living room, the boy saw a gush of blood come down from the ceiling. Helen leaves and meets with Bernadette, who is hearing a similar story about a babysitter dying. Helen goes into a college lecture hall, where the professor, Trevor, is talking about urban legends. Helen berates Trevor for doing the lecture without waiting for her and Bernadette to gather more stories. Helen is typing in a classroom after dark when a janitor comes in and hears Helen’s tape of the Candyman story. She says she has a friend who knows about it, and the friend comes in and tells Helen about someone she knew who was murdered with a hook. Helen goes to the library archives to look to at the newspaper articles about the friend they had been talking about. Helen shows Bernadette what she found in the newspaper, that her condo building was a housing project before it was converted to condos and was exactly like the place the friend had been killed and that the killer could have gotten in through the mirror. They both say Candyman five times and leave, laughing about it. They go to a rundown area of the city to find the source of the Candyman myth and encounter a group of young men who harass them as they make their way to the apartment the friend died in. They see the words sweets to the sweet painted on the wall, and in the apartment, they find a hole in the mirror. Helen crawls through the hole to the other apartment and investigates the apartment, finding candies with razor blades inside. Helen goes back through and the neighbor, Annemarie, catches them in the apartment. They go into Annmarie’s apartment and talk to her and she tells them how she heard the friend screaming through the walls and she’s scared that she’ll be hurt. At dinner with Trevor and another professor, Purcell, Purcell tells them of the origins of Candyman, that his father was a wealthy man in post-civil war era. He was commissioned to paint a young woman’s picture, but when he got the girl pregnant, her father had some men cut off his hand and cover his body in fresh honey, attracting the bees that they had taken the honey from. He was stung to death and his ashes were spread across the area. The next day, Helen goes back to see Annmarie and a boy, Jake, tells Helen she’s not there. She goads Jake into showing her where Candyman is. He leads her to a restroom building where a boy was attacked while his mother was in the store. Helen goes into the bathroom to investigate and finds sweets to the sweet smeared on the wall. She finds a toilet filled with bees and freaks out. She goes to leave when a man in black coat with a gang of three men. The man in black pulls out a hook and attacks Helen, claiming to be Candyman. After they leave, Jake finds her and gets her to a hospital. She identifies her attacker to the police and they tell her he’s the leader of a gang who was probably responsible for the murders she had heard about. She returns to school after her eye heals and Bernadette tells her that publishers are interested in their work. She leaves, and as Helen returns to her car, a man in a black fur lined coat appears, telling her he’s come for her. She says she needs to leave, but he says that she was not content with the stories, so he was obliged to come. He reveals a hook for his hand and tells her to come with him while she passes out. She wakes up in Annmarie’s apartment, covered in blood. She opens a door and finds her dog decapitated and Annmarie screaming for her baby. Helen grabs a knife and uses it to defend herself when Annmarie attacks her before the police come in and arrest her. She calls Trevor to come and get her, but he doesn’t answer. In her cell, she has a vision of Candyman with Annmarie’s baby. Trevor shows up the next morning with a lawyer to take her home. The lawyer tells them that she’s not being charged with anything yet because they need to find the baby first. Later, she demands to know where Trevor was when she called but he claimed to be fast asleep. She looks at some of the pictures she took in the abandoned apartment and sees one of Candyman standing behind her in a mirror. When in her bathroom, his hook bursts through the mirror. She runs out into the hallway and he’s blocking her way. He corners her in the kitchen and tells her that she’s destroyed his congregation and he needs to kill her to restore belief. Bernadette comes in and he kills her, making it look like she did. Trevor arrives and calls the police and they take her to a psychiatric hospital. Candyman comes to her again, taunting her with the baby, before she screams for help and gets sedated. When she awakes, she is taken to a doctor, manacled to a wheelchair, who tells her she’s been out for nearly a month and wants to hear the story of what happened to Bernadette. He shows her a video of the night she was committed, that there was no one in the room with her. She claims to be able to prove herself and calls for Candyman in the mirror in the doctor’s office. He appears behind the doctor and stabs him, releasing Helen from her manacles before flying out of the window. Helen escapes out the window and knocks out a nurse, stealing her clothes and making her escape. She goes home to find all of their things wrapped in plastic, the room being painted. She finds a student of Trevor’s painting the walls, half dressed. Trevor comes out and she confronts him about the girl. He calls the hospital and she leaves, going back to the abandoned apartment and through the hole to the other one. She finds a hole into the apartment above it and sees a mural depicting the origins of Candyman. She turns around and sees Candyman sleeping on a slab table, and when she stabs him with a hook, he awakes and pulls it out with no blood. She offers herself for the baby and he carries her to a table, where bees erupt from his mouth and coat. He pulls it open to reveal a ribcage swarming with bees, which cover her, stinging her and knocking her out. Candyman takes the baby, claiming it to be his. Helen awakes and sees the words “It was always you, Helen,” on the wall, next to a woman in the mural who looks like her. When she leaves the room, she hears the baby crying and climbs into a large pile of furniture, finding the baby inside. Jake sees her disappear inside with a hook and thinks it’s the Candyman. Others come out and light the pile on fire. Candyman comes to her inside the furniture, telling her she’s be with him now, and she stabs him with a flaming stick before crawling out, ion fire, with the baby. She gets it to Annmarie before dying of burns. At her funeral, Annmarie leads a long line of people to the grave, and Jake drops Candyman’s hook on her coffin. Back at home, Trevor is overcome with grief for Helen and calls her name five times in front of the mirror. She appears behind him, hook in her hand, and guts Trevor. Back in the abandoned apartment, someone has painted a mural of Helen as an angel rising from a bonfire.</p>
  <h3><a id="thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <p>I enjoyed this movie quite a lot, despite some subpar acting and cheap effects (Candyman’s body in the bonfire was pretty bad.). Virginia Madsen as Helen didn’t seem to be invested in the role, coming across as bored more than anything else. She didn’t emote well, either, her tone bland and flat most of the time. <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0865302/">Tony Todd</a> as Candyman, though, was pretty great! His tone was sinister and threatening and anytime he was on screen he drew all attention. What I enjoyed most about this movie was the message, the meaning behind it, that belief holds power, and that we create our own mythical figures. Candyman is incredibly poetic himself in his musings about belief, which was a major draw to me. But he himself was not enough to bring the movie up too high. </p>
