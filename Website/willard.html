  <h3><a id="summary">Summary</a></h3>
  <p>Willard works at a factory. As he’s leaving, his boss almost runs him down outside and demands he do some work over the weekend. He comes home to a surprise birthday party with his overbearing mother and her friends. They belittle him for losing control of the company before he can escape. Outside, he sees a rat and gets joy from feeding it. When he goes inside, his mother rings a bell to summon him and gives him a long list of things to do around the house and tries to guilt him. His boss bullies him at work and he meets a temp helper, Jo. At home, he tries to drown the rats in his garden but can’t and lets them escape. While training the rats, he finds a pure white one, names him Socrates, and brings him inside. A large rat whom Willard names Ben shows up while he’s training the others. Willard walks in on his boss trying to have his way with his secretary and tries to get a raise out of him and gets bullied more. He takes his rats to his boss’ party and sics them on the party in revenge. Willard gets called home for his mother’s death, he gets left nothing but a heavily mortgaged house. He chases mother’s friend out of the house. Ben keeps trying to get into the house. Office girl gets him a cat to help keep him company.

As Willard attacks Ben, the other rats attack him. </p>
  <h3><a id="thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <p>This movie…I hate this movie. I have read the book that this movie is “based on” and seen the remake, so I was expecting some fun rat action, but what I got was…practically nothing. There was no real horror to this. It’s a story about a boy and his rats and how they turn on him when he turns on them, but it never felt threatening. Why is the music so happy and orchestral? Bright and happy, swelling orchestral music in the beginning and never really changing, even on the “dark” scenes. After his mother dies, the music finally gets less “happy”, but not much. It never feels like it belongs in the scenes. Willard as a character was a jerk. I can’t feel too sorry for him because he’s kind of making his own trouble by not selling such a large house. I have no sympathy for the man, even after his rat was killed by his douchebag boss. Many of his troubles were his own doing. The boss character felt a bit much with his over-the-top Scooby Doo villain style scheming to get Willard’s house. The remake was infinitely better than this, with Crispin Glover being charismatic despite being creepy.</p>
