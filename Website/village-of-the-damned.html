  <h4>1960</h4>
  <h3><a id="summary">Summary</a></h3>
  <p>Professor Gordon Zellaby is on the phone with his brother-in-law, Alan, an agent for the British government when he and his entire village spontaneously fall asleep. Alan, worried for his Gordon and his sister, Anthea, goes to investigate and finds a bus pulled off the side of the road, everyone inside asleep. A police officer rides up and goes to investigate, but as soon as he gets near, he, too, falls asleep. Alan calls in the army, and they quarantine the village. After around four hours with no answers, the police officer and everyone on the bus promptly wake up, acting as if nothing had happened. Alan hurries on to his family’s house and fills them in on what happened. Nothing can be explained, and the incident is filed away. Two months later, every woman of child bearing age is found to be pregnant, leading to many fights and arguments between husband and wife, parent and child, but they soon stop as the pregnancies quickly accelerate in development. Every child is born on the same day and look similar to each other: platinum blonde hair, strange eyes, and similar facial construction. Gordon attends a government briefing on the children and learn that many other places experienced the same events, though only the village and a place in Russia have allowed the children to be born. As the children quickly grow, it’s discovered that they have a telepathic bond with each other, acting as a hive mind, behaving and dressing similarly. They can read minds and exert a force on other people, causing them to behave differently. Gordon sets them up in a school and teaches them himself, believing them to be the next step in evolution for humanity. He starts to think differently, though, when a car almost hits one of the children and they cause the driver to crash into a wall and explode. He decides that they need to be erased when they force a man, one of the husbands of the women who gave birth, tries to attack them with a gun and they force him to shoot himself. He concocts a plan to blow them all up, and hides the plan in his mind by thinking consistently of a brick wall, though his wife’s child, David, the leader of the children, manages to find out just before they and Gordon are destroyed. As the house they were in burns, eight sets of eyes glow in the darkness and fly off into the night.</p>
  <h3><a id="thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <p>Village of the Damned-Well acted by everyone, especially the kids. They were suitably creepy. When they activated their powers and the image on screen was just a still with edited eyes, the effect was very cheesy, but the crew was limited in what they could do in 1960. Overall, the movie was very unsettling, mostly from watching the people in the village interact with the children. That final scene with the floating eyes gave me legitimate chills in a way that few other movies have, and that alone raises its standing to high in my book</p>
