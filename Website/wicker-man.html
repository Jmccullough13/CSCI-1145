 <h4>1973</h4>
  <h3><a id="summary">Summary</a></h3>
  <p>Sergeant Howie, a policeman from Mainland Scotland, is called to an island to investigate the disappearance of a young girl, Rowan, after receiving a letter. When he arrives on the island, no one seems to remember who she is, including her mother. As he gets a room at the inn for the night, he sees pictures from previous years’ harvests and notices one is missing and meets Willow, the inn keeper’s daughter, and witnesses an innuendo-laden barroom song. He leaves to go for a walk and sees many people copulating on the ground outside, people watering trees that are planted on all of the graves, and a naked woman crying on a grave. The next day, he goes to the island’s school to find information about Rowan, once again running into people claiming she doesn’t exist. He finds her name in the school information and forces the teacher to talk to him. She tells him that they “don’t believe in death” and that she’s simply no longer in existence. He then finds her grave and goes back around the village to find out more about her, but gets more run around from the inhabitants before going to see the lord of the island, who tells him that the island was a community built by his grandfather, with people he brought by “freeing them” by allowing them to worship old gods. Frustrated, he exhumes the coffin and finds a hare instead of a human. That night, he breaks into the photographer’s house and finds the picture of the previous year’s harvest, with Rowan and very few crops. With this information, he deduces that because the previous year’s crop failed, they intent to use Rowan as a sacrifice. He tries to return to the mainland to get backup but his plane isn’t working. Instead, he searches every house for Rowan and is trolled by almost every inhabitant on the island. He’s forced to return to the inn, where he knocks out the inn keeper and takes his costume to join the revelries until he finds Rowan. He finds her at the end of the procession and leads her away from the people while they give chase. They emerge from the cave to find the lord and some others, who reveal that the entire investigation, from the original letter to every move he made on the island, was a set up to make him a sacrifice. He tries to escape, but they force him into a giant wicker man-shaped statue. As they light it on fire, he is praying while the inhabitants are all singing happily and cheerfully.</p>
  <h3><a id="thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <p>This movie was much better than I thought it would be. I knew it would be better than the remake, but not this good. It was innuendo laden and sexually charged, surprisingly so. I would like it more, but the movie tries to hard to show that all of what the inhabitants are doing is evil. Many scenes had unsettling camera angles and lighting to show what the inhabitants are doing is “bad and disturbing.” In some regards, teaching girls about sex in school to get them to focus on healthy pregnancies isn’t great, but the women seemed to have an equal standing with the men. There was a very heavy emphasis on religious differences. Howie is unsympathetic (to me) for most of the movie because he tells these people that they’re “heathens” for practicing their own religion. He keeps trying to tell them they’re wrong and evil, when most of what they do wasn’t hurting anyone in the slightest and affected no one but themselves. He tried to show that their religion is “bad” while compared to Christianity, but the only bad thing that they did was the sacrifice at the end. That’s my only complaint, and while it does hang over the movie, the acting, camera work, and direction of the movie was more than enough to distract from the flaws. The music was also fantastic, with many original songs that are still stuck in my head from time to time. The ending was, as with the best movies I’ve seen on this list, the best part. It was truly disturbing watching Howie pray as he knew he was about to die, juxtaposed over the happy villagers singing and dancing.</p>
