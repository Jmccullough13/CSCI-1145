  <h3><a id="summary">Summary</a></h3>
  <p>Casey gets a call from a stranger, tells them that it’s a wrong number, and hangs up. the stranger calls again twice before she talks to him. They chat about horror movies before he asks her name so he knows who he’s looking at. She gets upset and hangs up, locking her doors, before he calls again. She hangs up, and he calls again, threatening to gut her if she hangs up again. Her doorbell rings and she panics, threatening the caller with her boyfriend, but he tells her to turn on her lights out back and her boyfriend is bloodied and tied to a chair in her backyard. He demands that she answer some horror trivia questions to save his life, and when she answers one wrong, he guts her boyfriend. A chair crashes through her window and a figure in a black robe with a white mask enters her home. She runs outside and sees a car, but before she can run to it, the figure crashes through the window and stabs and strangles her. Her parents come home, but before she can call to them, she’s killed. Her parents find her hanging from a tree. Sidney is working on a school assignment when her boyfriend, Billy, knocks on her window, scaring her and comes in. They start to get intimate, but she stops him and he leaves, but not on bad terms. When Sydney goes to school the next day, she finds heavy police and media presence. Her friend, Tatum, tells her about Casey’s death. During her classes, Sydney is pulled from class and asked questions, to make sure she’s doing ok. After school, Sydney, Billy, Tatum, her boyfriend Stu, and a friend, Randy, are discussing the deaths and Stu and Randy are making jokes about it. Sydney watches some reports about the murders after school and they discuss her mother, who was assaulted and killed the year before. She falls asleep, but is awoken by a call from Tatum telling her she’s coming to get her. She gets another call from the killer, asking her about scary movies as he did with Casey. She thinks he’s Randy, but he tells her he’s not and that he’s on her front porch. She steps outside and sees no one, but he insists that he’s there. She goes to hang up, but he tells her if she does she’ll die like her mother. She runs inside and locks the door, but he’s behind her. He knocks her to the ground and tries to stab her, but she kicks him away and runs, barricading herself in her room. She tries to call 911, but he disappears from her door. She hears a sound at her window and Billy climbs in, concerned about her screaming. He hugs her, and a cell phone drops out of his pocket. Sydney backs away from him and runs to the front door, opening it to find the mask, an officer, Dewey, holding it up. They arrest Billy, finding the entire costume on the ground outside. Tatum pulls up, rushing to her, and tells Dewey, her brother, that she’s supposed to stay with her. They take Sydney and Billy to the station, where they tell Billy they have to keep him until they check his phone records. Gale, a reporter tries to get in to see Sydney and manages to find her as she and Tatum leave the station out the back. She mentions a book she’s writing and Sydney punches her in the face. At Tatum’s house, she gets a call from the killer telling her she got the wrong guy before telling her he’ll see her soon. The next morning, Dewey confirms that Billy’s innocent before driving her to school. She sees Gale and wants to talk to her about her mother’s case. Gale insists that the person who murdered Sydney’s mother was innocent, but Sydney is the one who’s confession put him away and he’s now on death row. Sydney walks away, angry, and waits for Billy in school with Stu and Tatum. Someone runs down the hall in the same costume as the killer and Sydney runs away and into Billy. They argue about their relationship and how it’s affected by her mother’s death. While in the bathroom, Sydney overhears two girls talking about her and how they think she’s making it up and she’s the killer. When they leave, Sydney hears something else and sees feet lower from the toilet. The killer bursts out of a stall and attacks her, but she escapes out of the bathroom and runs away. The principal suspends classes afterward and the city institutes a curfew of 9. Stu tells Tatum and Sydney that he’s going to throw a party and insists that they come. The principal is attacked and killed by the killer. Stu goes to the video store where Randy works to invite him to the party and they talk about Billy and the killings. Randy goes on about the how there’s a formula to the killings and that Billy is still the most likely suspect. While Tatum and Sydney are getting food for the party, Dewey and his chief discuss that the phone calls to Casey came from Sydney’s father’s phone. Sydney and Tatum are dropped off at the party by Dewey, who finds Gale lurking around outside. He says he’s going to go into the party and Gale invites herself along. Gale places a camera in the living room, trying to hide it from the others. While getting more beverages for the partiers, Tatum is trapped in the garage by the killer. She thinks it’s a prank and tries to move past him but he pulls a knife and cuts her arm. She throws the beers at him to escape and tries to crawl through a cat door in the garage door. Ghostface, as he is now named, raises the door, crushing her head against the roof. Billy arrives at the party, wanting to talk to Sydney. Gale goes back out to her truck and finds out that the camera she placed has a 30 second delay. Sydney and Billy make up and they get intimate. During the party, Randy and others are watching Halloween and Randy tells everyone the rules of surviving a horror movie. Dewey gets a report of an abandoned car down the road and incites Gale to check it out with him. Randy gets a call about the principal beings found dead and the rest of the party goers leave to see his body before they take it away. They drive too fast, knocking Dewey and Gale into the bushes, where they find Sydney’s father’s car. As Sydney and Billy finish, they discuss what happened to him after he was arrested, and Billy thinks that Sydney still thinks that he’s the killer. As he’s asking what he can do to prove it to her, Ghostface creeps in behind him and stabs him. He chases Sydney into the attic and as she’s trying to climb out, he grabs her, and she breaks free to fall on a boat below. As he gets up, she sees Tatum’s body still in the garage door and runs off, finding the news van. They see on the video that Ghostface is behind Randy, but he moves out of the room. When the cameraman in the van realizes that the feed is on a 30 second delay, he climbs out and his throat is cut by Ghostface. Sydney closes the door, but not before getting stabbed in the shoulder. She escapes the van and runs into the yard. Dewey, coming back, runs into the house and hears screams but finds Halloween still playing. Gale goes to the van to get a phone and finds blood on the ground. She calls 911 and hits Randy with the phone in a panic. She drives off, but runs off the road when Sydney runs to her for help, crashing into a tree. Sydney runs back to the house and sees Dewey stumble out, a knife in his back, followed by Ghostface. She traps herself in Dewey’s car, but Ghostface shows her the keys and messes with the door locks while sneaking in the back of the car. He attacks her, but she escapes back to the house. She grabs Dewey’s gun off of him as Stu and Randy run up to her, both pointing fingers at the other. She locks them out of the house as Billy stumbles down the stairs. Sydney helps him up and gives him the gun. Billy lets Randy in, who screams about how Stu’s gone mad, and Billy remarks that they all go mad sometimes and shoots Randy in the shoulder. Sydney runs into another room and into Stu, who pulls out a voice modulator and the voice on the phone comes out. They corner her in the kitchen and as she tells them they won’t get away with it, Billy tells her it was easy to frame her mother’s supposed killer. When asked why, they tell her that they didn’t need a motive. He tells her that her mother was sleeping with his father and that’s why his mother left him. Stu brings out Sydney’s father, bound and gagged, and tell her that they had been used his phone for the calls. Billy stabs Stu in the gut and Stu stabs Billy to make themselves look like the victims. Gale sneaks in and steals the gun but the safety is on. Billy kicks Gale out the door, knocking her out, and Sydney and her father disappear. Sydney calls the house phone with the cell phone and tells them she called the police. Billy goes to look for her and Sydney, dressed in the costume, stabs him with an umbrella. Stu attacks her and she drops a TV on his head. As Sydney is looking at the mask, Randy jumps up to check on her. Billy gets back up and attacks them, but Gale shoots him. As the three of them are looking at his body, Randy comments how in a horror movie, this would be when the killer jumps back up, not dead. Billy shoots upwards, but Sydney shoots him in the head. The police arrive and cart the injured off to the hospital while Gale delivers a report about the events of the night.</p>
  <h3><a id="thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <p>This is one of the movies on this list that I probably should have seen years ago but never did. I mentioned before that I’m not a fan of slasher movies for all of the tropes started in <a href="black-christmas.html">Black Christmas</a> that carried on and infested so many other movies. This movie is a parody that turned those tropes on their head, making fun of them while committing the same sin, and I loved it. They had all of the stupidity, and cringe of a normal slasher flick, but instead of leaning on it, they swerved at full speed into it. The best exemplification of this was when Randy was watching the movie and yelling at the screen to watch out, look behind them, and Ghostface walks in right behind him and raises the knife while Randy continues to yell at the screen. All of the gratuitous gore and violence went beyond the other slasher movies, but it served as a parody of those movies in its exaggeration. This movie was brilliant, and I wish I hadn’t known every single plot point going into it. Knowing didn’t lessen the movie, but it would have been a better experience if I hadn’t known beforehand. C’est la vie, perhaps I’ll learn from this.</p>
