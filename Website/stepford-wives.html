 <h4>1982</h4>
  <h3><a id="summary">Summary</a></h3>
  <p>Joanna, a photographer, Walter, a lawyer, and their children move from a big city apartment in New York to a small town community in Connecticut. On their first day, their neighbor Carol, who looks like she sprang forth from a 1950’s better home and gardens magazine, comes to greet them and brings them some food. The next day, Joanna sees Carol’s husband, Ted, grope Carol outside before leading her inside. When Joanna tells Walter about it, he plays it off as a joke and starts talking instead about the men’s association. Joanna and Walter don’t have a great relationship, with Walter making big decisions, like moving, without really getting Joanna’s input. Carol gets into an accident in a parking lot and instead of taking her to the hospital, they take her somewhere else. Walter gets home from his initiation into the men’s association and is visibly upset with something. The next day, Joanna meets Bobbie and they become fast friends, discussing their common lifestyles and interests. The men’s association has a small meeting at Walter’s house and the leader speaks to Joanna in the kitchen. While the men talk about charity work, one of the men sketches Joanna covertly while she becomes bored with their conversation. Walter starts to act differently than he had in New York, upsetting Joanna. Diz is having a party and Carol starts to act strange, repeating the same phrase over and over as she walks past groups of people. Joanna and Bobbie try to get the women to get together to make a women’s association, and at one house, they walk in to hear a couple having sex. They finally have luck with Charmaine, a tennis lover with her own court. During the meeting, Joanna and Charmaine try to get the women to have conversations about their lives but it devolves into discussions about cleaning products. While Joanna takes their dog out for a walk, men from the associations come in and look through her things and she winds up at the men’s association building and is confronted by a cop, telling her not to wander around at night. Joanna and Bobbie find out that there had previously been a women’s club but it was disbanded by Carol, who had been the previous leader. While Joanna is in New York trying to get some of her photos displayed, their dog disappears, and when she and Bobbie go out to look for him, they see that Charmain is tearing out her tennis court and has changed to be like the other women in town, talking about cleaning the house and cooking. Joanna and Bobbie think something is up in the water of the town and take a sample to a chemist to find out, but he finds nothing. Joanna tries to convince Walter to move and he agrees, but not until later. Bobbie goes away for the weekend with her husband and Joanna manages to get some of her photos to be put on display. When she goes to tell Boobie, she finds that Bobbie has changed like the other women. She’s obsessed with cleaning and doesn’t want to leave anymore. Joanna tried to discuss it with Walter and he flips out on her, demanding that she goes to see a psychiatrist if she wants to move. The psychiatrist tells her that she should leave with the kids, but when she returns home, the kids are missing. Walter attacks Joanna when she demands to know where they are and she locks herself in her room. When Walter calls Diz,, she escapes and goes to Bobbie, looking for her kids. Upset with hoe Bobbie has changed, Joanna stabs Bobbie. Bobbie doesn’t bleed, and as she pulls the knife out, she starts to throw things around and repeat several phrases continuously. When Joanna returns home and attacks Walter, demanding to know where the children are, he tells her they’re at the men’s association. She goes to get them and is tricked by Diz into getting locked into the building. She tries to escape from the building and finds herself in a mock-up of her bedroom, including her missing dog, with a black-eyed copy of herself. The copy advances on her with a stocking, and the scene changes to a grocery store, where all of the women are greeting each other in the aisles, including Joanna, who is now like all of the other women.</p>
  <h3><a id="thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <p>A decent commentary that’s still poignant and relevant now. I enjoyed the building tension throughout the movie, how it felt earned and not created. The movie serves as a commentary on culture and men’s power. The women were the strongest characters in this movie, the men the weakest, but the men still win. I didn’t particularly like any actor in this movie. I felt that they were all a little too extra, too liberal, too creepy, too selfish, like all of them went just a step too far. That didn’t stop them from building real tension throughout the movie, ratcheting up as the movie went on. The ending was creepy as fuck, especially with the pleasant song playing over it easily the best part of the movie, and the black eyes on the Joanna doppelganger gives me chills when I still think about them</p>
