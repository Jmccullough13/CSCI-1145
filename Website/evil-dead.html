 <h4>1981</h4>
  <h3><a id="summary">Summary</a></h3>
  <p>Five friends, Ash, his girlfriend Linda, his sister Cheryl, their friend Scotty, and his girlfriend Shelly, are going to a cabin in the woods for the weekend. On the way, they almost run into a truck and fall through a bridge. While sitting and drawing a clock, the clock stops and something takes possession of Cheryl’s hand, forcing her to draw something that looks like a book. She has a vision of a trap door flapping up against a chain. While eating dinner, they hear a thud and go into the living room to find a trap door opened to the cellar. Scotty goes down to check it out, but when they call down to him, he doesn’t answer. Ash goes down after him and gets jump scared. They find a book, a knife, and a recording machine. They bring up the machine to listen to while the moon becomes covered with a shadow. The recording is from an archeologist who had excavated some ruins from Ancient Sumer and found the book, which they called the book of the dead, bound in human flesh and inked in human blood, and was filled with rituals to allow demons to possess people. The recording plays a ritual and outside, the earth begins to crack and pulse. A tree branch crashes in through a window and Cheryl runs off, screaming. Later that night, she hears something outside and goes to investigate where he gets attacked and molested by vines. She escapes and makes it back to the cabin and demands to leave, but when they get in the car, it won’t start, and they find the bridge torn apart. Later, while Ash is listening to more of the tape, Cheryl becomes possessed, stabs Linda in the ankle, and throws Ash across the room. Scotty shoves her into the basement and traps her. After they argue about what to do, Shelly goes to lie down but is attacked through the window. She gets possessed and attacks Scotty in the bathroom, but he fights her off and knocks her into a fire. He pulls her off and she tries to stab him with a shard of glass, but he stabs her with the knife found in the basement, causing her to spew white liquid and fall to the floor, apparently dead. She quickly revives quickly and attacks him again and he hacks her apart with an, though her parts are still moving. Ash and Scott bury her body and discuss what to do next. Scott leaves, upset, and Ash goes to check on Linda’s leg and the wound spreads something throughout her body, seemingly causing her to get possessed. Scott comes back broken and bloody and claims the trees won’t let them leave, there was a way out on a trail. Linda and Cheryl pretend to be normal to trick Ash into letting Cheryl out, but Linda reverts and Ash drags her outside. He tends to Scott but Linda attacks him with the Sumerian knife and he turns it on her, killing her. He straps her to a table and is going to dismember her with a chainsaw, but can’t and buries her instead. She revives after buried, clawing his leg open, and he beats her with a beam before decapitating her with a shovel. When he returns to the house, he finds the trap door broken open and Cheryl escaped. He shoots her with a shotgun and flees to the basement, where the pipes, wall sockets, and walls themselves start to leak blood. Everything in the house goes crazy and Cheryl attacks Ash through the door. He shoots her in the jaw and is attacked by a possessed Scott. Ash gouges his eyes out and tries to go after the book, but Cheryl and Scott attack him again, Scott biting his leg and Cheryl beating him with a poker. He gets the book and tosses it into the fire, causing the possessed to rapidly decompose. Huge clawed hands burst out of them before they decompose completely. The sun rises and the clock resumes ticking as usual. Ash stumbles out of the house, and as he approaches the car, something soars along the ground, through the house, and attacks Ash. </p>
  <h3><a id="thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <p>Mug it <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0132257/">Bruce</a>! Seriously though, he put in a lot of work in this movie. I felt he was a great actor! The camera work was all over the place, ranging from excellent shots like the camera zooming over the ground, especially the end shot with it going through the cabin, but then there were shots like in the beginning in the car, where it kept cutting to them, then outside, then to one of them, then something else, rapidly and repeatedly. It’s almost like jump scares which aren’t effective at being scary. There were shots in the cellar when Scott and Ash found the book, knife, and tape recorder, which built atmosphere and made me think anything was about to happen. The music was great too, lending well to the atmosphere. The best part was how Ash kept getting shoved into bookshelves whenever action was happening, leaving him out of it until the end. The deadites (because I know what they’re called) act like children, mocking and jeering, and got on my nerves. However, the effects on them were great, though I was a little put off by the stop motion. The characters were kind of stupid, too, but it made sense that they weren’t thinking straight in the life-or-death situation they were in. I didn’t think was great watching it, but as I reflected on it, I realized how amazing it really was. </p>
