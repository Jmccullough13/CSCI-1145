 <h4>1965</h4>
  <h3><a id="summary">Summary</a></h3>
  <p>Several men are getting onto a train at a station and into the same compartment. A sixth man, Dr. Terror, gets on and spills his bag after falling asleep. The other men help clean it up and finds a tarot deck. Curios, they ask the purpose, and he explains that it’s meant to be used to tell the future. One of the men, Marsh, starts naysaying the deck, so the doctor offers to read Marsh’s fortune. Another man, Jim, asks to be read first. The doctor agrees and pulls his cards, starting the first segment. Jim is hired to make changes to the house he recently sold to a rich widow, Mrs. Biddulph. As they discuss the changes, howls can be heard outside. Jim tells Mrs. Biddulph that he needs to stay the night to be able to check on the walls she wants to knock out, and while he checks around the house, the servants seem to be stalking him, watching as he works. Jim goes into basement and finds a false wall, knocking it out to find a hidden coffin of a man who claimed the house was his and swore revenge. He and one of the servants pull out coffin to examine it. As they leave the basement to find something to open it, a claw pokes out of the coffin. When they come back, they find the basement door open despite having been locked. A young maid is found attacked, and the men follow blood trails into the house. Jim follows the blood to the basement and to the coffin. Spooked, he takes a silver heirloom and melts it down into bullets. Mrs. Biddulph is heard to be screaming, but when Jim goes to investigate her, she turns out to be the real werewolf and attacks him. Back to train, Jim reveals he’s on his way to the island in the story. Bill, the man closest to the door, takes his turn. He and his family are returning from vacation when they find a long vine growing against his house. Bill tries to cut it down, but his hoe and shears break on it. He confides in some botanists, one of which drops in to stay to figure it out. Soon after, the family dog is killed by the vine. The scientist theorizes that plant is next stage in evolution that tries to attack anything that harms it. While he’s working, the plant attacks and kills the doctor. The other botanist arrives, and the plant cuts phone line when he tries to call for help, growing around the house to trap them in. However, the plant shies away from fire when the botanist lights his pipe. The botanist lights a cone of paper to allow escape, but as he does, the plant closes on the house again, and a vine is seen to be reaching for the lighter he dropped. The third man, Biff, is a musician in a jazz band. They get a booking in the West Indes to play at a club. Biff talks with the previous band on their way out and calls an image of a “god” on a woman’s pendant a monster. The previous band member tells him about a religious gathering that the people hold in the woods at night, and Biff sneaks in to take a peek. While he’s transcribing the music he hears played, he’s caught by people attending the ceremony while ogling a dancing woman. The rest of the band finds the music that Biff had transcribed and warn him not take it or the god will be revenged. He laughs it off and back home, he makes the song into a club song, creating a backdrop to go with it that looks like the religious group’s gathering. During the song, the doors blow open and a strong wind blows through the club, driving everyone out. Biff refuses to give up the song and goes home. At home, wind blows all the doors closed in his house. The lights go out, and when they come back on, a man painted like the religious group members appears and takes the music from Biff as he falls to the floor. Marsh takes his turn next. He’s an art critic and is at a gallery, making fun of the painter there. The painter calls him out on his criticisms and shows him a painting that he praises highly, but rushes out when the painting is revealed to have been painted by a chimp. At a speaking event, the painter taunts Marsh with a cut out of a chimp, causing him to stop. The painter continues to torment Marsh, and in a fit of rage, Marsh hits the painter with a car, crushing his hand. Afterward, Marsh acts very jumpy and guilty. The painter loses his hand and shoots himself. Soon after, the severed hand appears in Marsh’s car and attacks him, but Marsh throws it out the window. The hand sneaks into his house and Marsh throws it into the fire. The hand appears at his work the next day and tries to choke him before it gets locked in a box and thrown into a river. As Marsh is driving home in the rain the next day, the hand appears on windshield and causes a crash, blinding Marsh. The final passenger, an American named Bob, takes his turn. He is bringing a new French bride to his home in New England. He cuts himself on a can opener, which she licks off. She awakens at night, turns into a bat and flies off. Bob’s friend arrives to take him to work and his Bob’s wife looks very upset to see him. At work, Bob and his friend see a patient who has a lack of blood and find pierced wounds on his neck. They joke it was a vampire. That night, Bob’s wife stalks his friend at his lab, but he hears her footsteps and hides When he comes out, he is attacked by a bat. The friend requests to stay the night in the boy’s room to watch over him and shoots at a bat trying to get in through the window. Bob’s wife appears at home in the bedroom, her hand bleeding. The friend insists that Bob’s wife is the vampire and tries to convince Bob. Bob stays awake until she returns for the night and stakes her in the heart. As he’s arrested for killing his wife, Bob tries to insist that the friend told him to, but the friend refuses to back up his story. As Bob is taken away, the friend turns to look at the camera and says “This town is too small for two doctors, or two vampires,” before turning into a bat. Back on the train, the doctor reveals that he is death and that the five men had died in a train crash. </p>
  <h3><a id="thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <p>I was looking forward to this movie as it has three actors I love and were also in the second movie I watched, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000489/">Christopher Lee</a>, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001088/">Peter Cushing</a>, and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001284/">Michael Gough</a>. I also am a huge fan of horror anthology movies. The segments were fine for what they were, except for the middle one with the voodoo music. That was very, very cringeworthy. The effects were not great, even for 1965, I feel, with one exception. The werewolf was terrible, a dummy head thrown from the side of the screen. The plant was better, being a decent puppet that could be moved around. Biff’s acting reminded me, badly, of the acting from Ralph at the beginning of <u>The Rocky Horror Picture Show</u>. Trying too hard, not natural at all. The voodoo priest wasn’t really trying, either. He’s also a moron, still playing while a miniature tornado rips through the club. Marsh deserved everything he got. The hand was well done, though, crawling semi-realistically. I think most of the budget went to that hand. The bats were beyond the worst thing in the movie, cheap toys on a string.…The movie was cheesy and campy, but decently enjoyable, sans that middle segment. The acting by most was good, as well, and it was great to see <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000661/">Donald Sutherland</a> as a "baby"!.</p>
