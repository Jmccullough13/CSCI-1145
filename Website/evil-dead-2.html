  <h3><a id="summary">Summary</a></h3>
  <p>The history of the book of the dead is given more in-depth. Ash and his girlfriend Linda are driving for a getaway to a remote cabin in the woods. Ash is playing piano while Linda is dancing to the music. Ash goes to get champagne and finds a tape recorder on a desk. When he plays it, the professor narrates his find of the book of the dead and that it allows dark things to take possession of people. While it reads a translation of the book’s rituals, something outside moves towards the house and breaks in, possessing Linda. Ash finds her missing in the house and goes to find her outside, where she attacks him and knocks him to the ground. She lunges at him and he grabs a shovel, knocking her head off. He buries her body, and as the sun rises, something else moves through the forest and the house and grabs Ash, flinging him through the treetops and possessing him, but as the sun comes up, it’s driven out of him and he passes out. He awakens much later and sees a vision of a skull on the house telling him to join the demons. Ash tries to drive away but finds the bridge torn up. The sun sets and something starts to chase him. He drives away but hits a tree, launching from the car. It chases him back to the house and through the houses, but loses him when he drops into the trap door. At an airfield, the professor’s daughter, Annie, gets off a plane and tells the professor’s associate, Ed, that she found the missing pages from the book. She’s going to go to the cabin to find her father and translate the rest of the pages. Ash hears music in the cabin and finds the piano playing itself and starts to grieve the loss of Linda. Outside, Linda’s mostly rotten body rises from the grave Ash buried it in and starts to dance, gaining her head back in the process. She grabs Ash through the window. He wakes up from a dream and freaks out a bit before Linda’s head drops into his lap and bites his hand. He tries to fight it off and goes out into the work shed and uses a vice to get it off his hand. He reaches for a chainsaw and finds a chalk outline instead. Linda’s body bursts in, wielding the chainsaw and Ash manages to turn the chainsaw on itself. He uses the chainsaw to cut the head up. He returns to the house and finds a shotgun and investigates a chair rocking by itself. When it stops, he goes to examine himself in a mirror and his reflection comes out, trying to strangle him. He snaps out of his daze and his right hand becomes possessed, attacking him. He screams at the demons to give him back his hand. Annie and Ed approach the cabin, but are stopped by a tow truck blocking the road because of the bridge. The truck driver, Jake, and his girlfriend Bobby Joe offer to show them a trail to the house if they get paid. Ash’s hand continues to attack him, smashing plates and other objects on his head, knocking him out. While he’s unconscious, it sees a knife out of reach and drags Ash over to it, but Ash wakes up and stabs it with a knife, pinning it to the ground before cutting it off with the chainsaw. Ash traps his hand under a bucket, but while he’s binding his arm, it escapes. Ash shoots it through the wall but a fountain of blood gushes out, turning black before pulling back into the wall. A deer head mounted on the wall above the fireplace comes to life and starts laughing at him, followed by every inanimate object in the house. Ash joins them in laughing, but it all stops when he hears something outside the front door and shoots at it. Jake attacks him and knocks him out. Annie comes in, sees the chainsaw, and thinks he killed her parents, the owner of the cabin. They trap him in the basement, knocking him down the ladder. Annie plays the rest of the recording, and they find out that the professor’s wife Henrietta was possessed and tried to kill him. He buried her in the cellar, and as the recording stops, Henrietta bursts out of the ground and chases him up. The others let him out of the cellar as he’s attacked, and Henrietta attacks Jake. They trap Henrietta back in the basement and Ash explains about the thing that lives in the woods. Henrietta turns back to normal and tries to trick them into letting her out. When they refuse, Ed becomes possessed and attacks them. Ash gets an axe and dismembers Ed and Henrietta, stopping the attack for now. Jake remarks that the trail they came in on has disappeared and something starts to attacks the house. Ash thinks that it’s something trying to break through into their world, and something makes a noise in the bedroom. Ash and Annie go to investigate it with Jake and Booby Joe following, and they see the professor’s spirit, which tells the, that the pages Annie found are the way to stop the demons. Ash’s hand grabs Bobby Joe and she runs off into the woods, where she’s attacked by the trees, wrapping her up and dragging her into the dark. Annie and Ash read through the pages, where they see the drawing of a man who was said to have destroyed the evil in the 1300s. They read through some of the rituals before Jake points the gun at them and takes the pages, dropping them into the cellar and forcing them to go looking for Bobby Joe with him. Jake runs off and screams for Bobby Joe and is attacked by a possessed Ash. Annie flees back to the cabin and locks Ash out, but she hears something and, grabbing a knife found with the book, stabs Jake on accident. She drags Jake back into the house, where’s he grabbed by Henrietta and killed. Ash breaks in and attacks Annie before seeing Linda’s pendant and fighting the demon off. Annie attacks Ash, but he stops her. They modify the chainsaw to fit on Ash’s stump and go into the cellar to retrieve the pages. He gets them to Annie to read but is attacked by Henrietta. Henrietta escapes the cellar and attacks Annie. Ash gets her off Annie and she elongates her neck to attack Ash. Annie distracts her and Ash dismembers her, blowing her head apart with the shotgun. Outside, the trees uproot themselves and attack the house. Annie tries to read more of the passage as a giant head breaks in the front door, but she’s stabbed by the knife, wielded by the hand. She manages to open a hole in time and space, part of the ritual, and it sucks the head into the tunnel. She dies before she can close it, and it sucks Ash into it also, pulling him into the 1300s. When he lands, he’s surrounded by men in armor who want to kill him for being a deadite. A demon flies in, and Ash shoots its head off. The knights hail him as the one prophesied to come from the sky and save them.</p>
  <h3><a id="thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <p>I felt very confused at the beginning of this movie. I didn’t know it was a soft reboot leading into a sequel, which baffles me. They could have started right from the end of the <a href="evil-dead.html">the first one</a>! The acting quality declined sharply from the first. <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0132257/">Bruce Campbell</a> brought his biggest fork and knife to the set, and apparently, there was enough scenery left over for everyone else. The setting was mostly the house and the woods, but when it wasn’t, it was a lot of painted backdrops that weren’t used nearly as well as in The Thing. The jokes were kind of cringey as well, nothing nearly as funny as Ash being thrown into every bookcase and it falling on him. The joke with A Farewell to Arms hurt me physically. Ash was made of rubber or he’d have been dead ten times over after falling into the basement. The effects were amazing though, just like the original, and a lot of the camera shots were really good, especially the fast-moving shots through the woods. The strange slanting shots were nauseating, though, which may have been on purpose. The first one was much better. </p>
