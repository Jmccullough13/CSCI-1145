 <h4>1958</h4>
  <h3><a id="summary">Summary</a></h3>
  <p>A night watchman finds a woman using a heavy machine to crush a body. Helene calls her brother-in-law Francois to tell him that she’s killed her husband Andre, but insists she didn’t murder him to the police. She’s placed under police care, thinking she’s insane, though acts calm and level-headed. While under police protection, she gets very agitated whenever flies come near. After several days, she tells the Francois and inspector what happened leading up to the destruction of Andre. Andre was a scientist developing projects for the government. In his spare time, he created a machine that teleports matter between two chambers. After several mishaps, including a cat that never rematerialized, he claims to have fixed it, but after trying it again, he never emerges from the lab. When Helene tries to find out why, he communicates only with typed notes, covering his face with a black cloth when he allows her to enter the lab. He asks her to find a fly with a white head and she clutches at his arm, revealing a black claw instead of a hand. He explains that when he teleported himself, a fly got in and they switched parts of their bodies. He reveals his head is a fly’s head, and that his intelligence is waning. If he can’t find the fly and switch back, he’ll lose himself completely. Helene and their son Philipe try and find the fly, but they lose it and it gets outside. Andre insists that they destroy him before he can hurt anyone, and Helene reluctantly agrees. They crush his body, hiding any evidence of the fly body parts. In the present, the inspector deems her insane and that they can’t prosecute her for murder, but if they can find the fly, then they can prove her story and prove her innocence. Francois finds the fly trapped in a spider web, about to be eaten by a spider, and shows the inspector as Helene is carried away. In a fit of panic and disgust, the inspector crushes it with a rock, and the two make up a story, exonerating the wife.</p>
  <h3><a id="thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
   <p>I chose this movie because I had always wanted to watch it and felt that this was the perfect excuse and because I have always wanted to watch more <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001637/">Vincent Price</a> movies. This movie was, to me, surprisingly well acted by almost everyone. Helene especially was great, switching between calm to despair and back quickly and believably. Even the maid in the movie showed exasperation well with her mistress when Helene demanded they not kill the fly. The only sore spot in the acting department was Andre, the supposed “lead”. He seemed wooden at times, speaking his lines as if he had merely memorized them, with little emotion behind the delivery. However, he shined when the fly mask was put on. His physical acting was amazing. It was a well-paced movie, no lags or filler scenes. The settings were repetitive, using only the same four or five sets, but I can’t fault them for that. The creation of tension from the leads trying to figure out what happened to Andre was well built up, and finally getting to see what had happened to him was a good payoff. My biggest complaint, though, was that there wasn’t enough <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001637/">Vincent Price</a>. The final, well-known scene (“Help me! Help me!”) was unnerving and chilling and still haunts me. Looking especially forward to rewatching the <a href="fly-1986.html">remake</a>.</p>
