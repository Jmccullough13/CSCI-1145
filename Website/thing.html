 <h4>1982</h4>
  <h3><a id="summary">Summary</a></h3>
  <p>A saucer flies through space and enters Earth’s atmosphere. The camera pans over Antarctica as a helicopter flies. A huskie runs underneath it and someone in the helicopter tries to shoot it. In the United States National Science Institute 4 base, the occupants are enjoying free time. Macready is playing computer chess and loses, spilling his drink into the machine. Some of the occupants spot the helicopter as it gets close and remark that it’s Norwegian. The helicopter lands and the gunner gets out and tries to throw a grenade. He drops it and it blows up the pilot and the helicopter. The gunner tries to shoot the dog again and gets one of the Americans in the leg. The dog runs off and the gunner gets shot in head. Windows, the radio technician, tries to reach their home base and can’t get through to anyone. Macready, the doctor, Copper, and one other take their own helicopter to check out the Norwegians base to find out why they had attacked. They find the base burned out and destroyed, blood on the ground and walls, and a dead man, wrists and throat slit. Further in the base, they find a large hollowed out prism made of ice, something clearly empty from it. Outside, they find the body of something they can’t identify, which they take back to their base and Copper demands that Blair perform an autopsy. He finds that the internal organs are very normal human organs, though the thing looks nothing like a human. Clark puts the dog with the others in a kennel outside, and when he leaves, the other dogs star to bark as the dog transforms into a writhing, tentacled mass with insect legs. Clark comes back to find out why they’re barking and sees the transformed dog. Macready hears the dogs barking and goes to investigate, sees the thing transforming into a bulking mass, and has Childs burn it with a flamethrower. Blair examines it and tells the others that it was trying to imitate the dogs but was killed before it could. He and Clark take blood samples from the dogs remaining and Clark tells Blair that he was alone with the dog for an hour and a half, which raises Blair’s suspicion. They watch a video device found in the Norwegian base and see the Norwegians digging something out of the ice. Macready and some others go to investigate the site of their dig and find the spaceship uncovered in the ice, estimated to have been there about 100,000 years. They find a hole carved in the ice the same size of the prism they found in the Norwegian base. Blair runs a scenario that shows the alien cells assimilating the dog cells and predicts that there’s a 75% chance that one of the crew has been infected. As Windows and Bennings are putting the original corpse of the thing in the storage shed, Fuchs approaches Mac and shows him some things he found in Blair’s notebook, that the bodies aren’t completely dead, and that Blair won’t come out of his room. The body gets a hold of Bennings, absorbs him, and escapes, but is surrounded by the others and burned. They burn the other bodies but can’t find Blair. Macready sees someone come out of the helicopter with an axe and finds that the helicopter’s controls have been destroyed. He hears a gunshot inside and finds Blair trying to destroy anything that could allow any of them to escape. They subdue him and lock him in the tool shed, where Mac talks to him and he warns Mac to watch Clark. Mac tells the others that it’s likely that some of the are infected and that none of them can be trusted. Copper says they can test their blood. They find the blood that was in storage from them was destroyed and they start to argue amongst themselves about who could have done it, Windows breaks into the weapons storage but is talked out of using the gun on anyone. Mac burns the blood and tells the others that he knows some of them are human or they’d all be attacking him. They drug Garry, Clark, and Copper with morphine and keep them under surveillance. While Fuchs is working on a way to test each other, the power goes out and he’s lured outside where he finds some of Mac’s clothes, shredded, which could mean that he’s infected, as the transformation shreds the clothes of the person. They find Fuchs’ body burned in the snow, and they think Mac did it. They lock him outside, but he gets in and threatens them with dynamite. Norris passes out and they get Copper, who tries CPR on him, only for Norris’ chest to open into a jaw and bite Copper’s hands off. Mac burns his body, but the head escapes off the body, grows leg like a spider, and tries to escape. Mac burns it and tries to get everyone tied up to test their blood, shooting Clark as he tries to rush Mac with a scalpel. He tests their blood and Palmer’s blood erupts into strange masses. Palmer transforms and attacks Windows before being burned and exploded. They burn Windows before he can fully transform, then tests the last two, Childs and Garry. They’re human, leaving five people left: Childs, Mac, Garry, Nauls, and Blair. They go to test Blair and find him gone, having escaped through the floor of the tool shed and through tunnels in the snow. They find the beginnings of a ship being built. As they try to build weapons to defend against Blair, they see Childs run off on his own, and the power goes off in the camp, meaning the generator was destroyed. To stop the things from being frozen and found again to start anew, Mac, Nauls, and Garry set the rest of the base on fire. They head to the generator room and find the generator missing. While planting bombs to blow the base, Blair attacks and assimilates Garry. Nauls goes to check on him and disappears. Mac follows and lights a stick of dynamite, but the thing attacks from underground. Mac gets the stick and sets off the charges, blowing it and the base up. Childs returns and tells Mac that he ran off after what he thought was Blair in the snow. They share a bottle of liquor and sit to wait and see what happens next.</p>
  <h3><a id="thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <p>This is another movie I had seen already, but I love it so much. It’s my favorite horror movie and I needed to see it again and make it part of this project. The brilliance of this movie’s tension is the inability to trust anyone and the isolated location. The effects were amazing, best I’ve seen in any movie. Almost everything was done in real-time with prosthetics or makeup, and when there was stop motion, it didn’t feel too janky or obvious, save for the transformation at the very end of the movie. Norris’ head looks like real flesh, and when Blair put his fingers in Garry’s face, it looked incredibly realistic. The settings were obviously very overused, but in this case, it felt earned and real, since they were so isolated. There were plenty of painted backdrops that were obvious, but they were used well, such as the perspective shot when Mac, Copper, and Garry went into pit to look at the spaceship. The acting was phenomenal. Kurt Russel put in a lot of work. </p>
