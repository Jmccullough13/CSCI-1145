  <h4>1962</h4>
  <h3><a id="summary">Summary</a></h3>
  <p>In Kansas, three women in a car are challenged to a race by three men in another car. During the race, the women’s car is run off of a rickety bridge and into a river. After hours of searching, no one can find the car, but one of the women, Mary, emerge from the water onto a small island some ways off with no memory of the past few hours. Shaken by the experience, she moves to Salt Lake City to play the organ for a church. On her drive, haunting music plays from her radio and she sees the image of a pale, ghoulish figure in her window. Panicked, she stops at a gas station and sees a building in the distance. She is told that it’s a pavilion that used to be a carnival ground, but it now is condemned and blocked off. She rents a room and goes to visit her job site and her boss, the pastor. She asks about the pavilion, and he offers to take her, though he stops her from going inside. At her room, she meets John, the only other lodger, who quickly hits on her and tries to force his way into her room. She sees the pale man again downstairs and freaks out, but her land lady sees nothing. The next morning, she goes shopping for clothes, but suddenly everything becomes quiet and no one can hear her or interact with her. She wanders around, desperately trying to get someone to talk to her, and finally begins to hear again. The man appears again and she runs off and into a doctor, who takes her to his office and gets her to talk to him to try and dispel her fears. When she goes back to work and starts practicing, she begins to play eerie, haunting music and sees pale people dressed in black dancing inside the pavilion. The pastor hears her playing and demands that she resigns because her music is “sacrilege.” Mary agrees to an outing with John and he and another guy talk about having a night with her. When propositioned, Mary is uninterested and goes home, but John follows, insistent. Mary sees the man again in her mirror and brings John into her room, but when she tells him of her fears, he leaves, thinking she’s insane. She decides to leave and go back to where she came from but when she is getting her car checked out, everything becomes silent again, and she flees the car, running to the doctor’s office after the sound comes back. In the office, the man is sitting in the doctor’s chair, and Mary runs off, scared, and tries to get on a bus back home, but the bus is filled with the people she had seen dancing in her vision. She wakes up again in the car, all of it having been a nightmare, and drives off, drawn back to the pavilion. She enters and sees the dancers again, but she is among them, dancing with the man she had seen. She flees and the dancers chase her around the pavilion to the beach, where they converge on her. The next day, the pastor and the doctor are at the pavilion with an officer, trying to find her. They see her footprints running towards the water, along with multiple other tracks, though they stop and disappear before the water’s edge. At her home, the car is found and dredged up, revealing that Mary was still in the car and dead all along.</p>
  <h3><a id="thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <p>This movie was very amateurish, but had some amazingly good bones in it. The atmosphere was very good, tense and dramatic with good moments of horror. The organ music really set the mood and tone for the entire movie. The actress playing Mary did a phenomenal job for such a small budget, “take the money and run” role. The worst parts were the scenes with the creeper John. They tended to take me out of the movie somewhat, making it hard to get back in some parts, but the ending had me completely entranced, eyes glued to the screen. I will happily watch this movie again and again, just to see if I can find anything new in it.</p>
