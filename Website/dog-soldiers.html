 <h4>2002</h4>
  <h3><a id="summary">Summary</a></h3>
  <p>A couple are camping in the woods, celebrating a milestone in his writing career with a silver letter opener. While celebrating that night in their tent, someone starts to unzip the opening. They grab the woman by her leg, gutting her when he tries to pull her back in. Cut to a man, Cooper, running through the woods, evading capture by a man with a dog. Another man, his captain, finds him behind a tree and congratulates him on evading detection for 23 hours before commanding him to kill the dog. When he refuses, the sergeant shoots the dog himself and Cooper tries to attack him. Four weeks later, a platoon including Cooper is dropped into the highlands of Scotland for a training exercise against special forces. The squad moves out, taking a break in a patch of woods, where Cooper tells them that not far from the place they’re in, a couple was mauled by something that was never found, and that people disappear in that part of the woods constantly. When they make camp for the night, they share fears with each other, and the Sarge shares a story about a friend who got blown up by an antitank mine in Iraq to sober the up and keep them focused. A mutilated cow flies into their camp and some of the men want to call back to HQ because the wounds on the cow look like teeth marks instead of knife wounds. Something is hunting Ryan, the captain who killed the dog, and attacks him in the night. The next day, the squad is investigating where the cow came from when they come across a camp, including the remains of the men of an expedition. They change to live ammunition and the sarge tells them top call the base for immediate evac. They find Ryan, injured badly, raving about how there was only supposed to be one. They hear some howling and move out, breaking for the forest for cover while Ryan tells them their ammo will be useless against the thing that attacked him. As they split up to cover the area, one of the men sees something, but his gun jams and he runs, impaling himself on a fallen tree before something rips him off of it. The Sarge is attacked, getting somewhat disemboweled, and Cooper finds him and helps him put his guts back in while shooting the thing attacking them. The men reconvene and flee through the trees, firing at the thing attacking them. They come across a jeep being driven by Megan, who pulls them all in, but they’re stuck in the mud as the werewolf attacks the jeep. They manage to get out and drive off, finding a house to rest and dress Sarge’s wound. No one seems to be home despite a fire in the fireplace and food cooking on the stove. Cooper finds a dog in the house and they stop to dress the men’s wounds. They make plans to leave the house, but when they check the car, they find it torn apart and surrounded by at least three werewolves. They manage to get back in, and Megan asks why they’re there if not for a rescue mission. Megan and Cooper take Sarge upstairs to glue his abdomen back together. Once he’s taken care of, Megan fills the men in on what they’re up against. Cooper confronts Ryan about his wound, since he seems to be moving around find, and they attack him to find that his wound has completely healed. While they tie him up, the werewolves kill the generator. After Cooper get the men situated to defend, the werewolves attack at all of the doors, trying to divide their attention. One of the wolves gets a shotgun from one of the man and tries to shoot him, but he gets it back and lobs a grenade. They manage to drive the wolves off after they try to attack the Sarge, though one of them gets one of the men through the window. Cooper wants to get him back, but Ryan tells them to not bother. Megan tells them about an old land rover kept in the barn of the house, but she doesn’t know where the keys are. Cooper sends one of the men out to distract the wolves while another tries to hotwire the car, lowering a rope for the distraction to climb up and down again. He gets clear, but the wolves grab the rope and pull, trapping Cooper between the bed and the wall. Megan cuts the rope, freeing him, while the driver gets the car started, but sees a wolf chewing on someone. He backs out, but another wolf got into the car and kills him. Megan drives the wolf off with a handgun, but the car is unusable. They force an explanation out of Ryan, who tells them that the special weapons division wanted one of the wolves to turn into a weapon. They used Cooper’s unit as bait to lure the wolves out and capture one, but they underestimated enemy numbers. Ryan breaks loose and turns, getting driven out by Cooper using a sword. Megan figures out where they’re hiding, and Cooper and the others create molotovs and plan to blow them up using gas tanks they found in a closet. Sarge and Cooper talk and Sarge reveals that his wound is healed, meaning that he’s going to turn soon, too. He wants to go on his own terms and sacrifice himself to kill all of the wolves to allow the remaining humans to leave. They use the car to send a tank into the barn, trailing gas behind it, and light the trail, allowing Cooper, the driver, to bail before it explodes. Megan reveals that she lied about the wolves in the barn and about anything nearby, that she lured them here to be fed on, and she unlocked the doors to let them all in. She starts to turn, but Sarge shoots her between the eyes. Cooper and Sarge barricade themselves in a bathroom in the upstairs as the last soldier fights a werewolf in the kitchen and dies. Cooper and Sarge shoot through the floor to get downstairs, barricading themselves in the kitchen. Sarge orders Cooper into the cellar as he starts to turn, once more insisting on going out in his own way. He cuts the gas line in the kitchen and blows the entire house, killing himself and the wolves in the process. Cooper finds the remains of Ryan’s men in the basement and is attacked by Ryan. While knocked down, he finds the silver letter opener left by the campers and stabs Ryan with it, weakening him enough to let Cooper shoot him in the head. Cooper and the dog make it out.</p>
  <h3><a id="thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <p>This was a decent low budget horror movie. Not as good as others because it relies far, far too much on actions scenes, but it was decent overall. The camera work was great during the non-action scenes, focusing exactly where it needed to for the scene, but during action scenes, the cuts were waaay too choppy and jumpy, showing several shots of the exact same actions, but from different levels, or too fast to see anything that was actually happening. Megan’s betrayal was a bit confusing, and I wasn’t sure if she was always a werewolf or if she had just become one. Her wording made nothing but her betrayal clear. Other than those, I have no real complaints about this movie. The dialogue was great, the jokes spot on for a horror movie. There were some funny moments, but they never overshadowed the horror, letting it take the front seat when needed and never cutting in. The acting was pretty solid, too. I believed every man in this cast was a solider or had been at some point. The camaraderie between them was completely believable.</p>
