 <h4>1999</h4>
  <h3><a id="summary">Summary</a></h3>
  <p>The footage in this movie is of three people who disappeared in the woods and found later. The footage starts in Heather’s apartment, showing the equipment they’re taking with them into the woods. Josh shows up with the camera, and they go to get Mike, the final member of their group, before going shopping for supplies. They then interview people about the Blair Witch. They shoot some footage to be the opening of the documentary they’re making, starting with information about Burkitsville, formerly Blair, and the high child mortality rate in Burkitsville. They find several other people in the town about the Blair Witch, hearing a story about a man who lived in a cabin in the mountain who abducted seven kids and killed them in the 1940’s. They hear about a woman who had an encounter with the witch and talk to her. She tells them that when she was a kid, she was fishing when a woman with coarse hair covering her body and a shawl approached her. They don’t take her seriously as she also said she’s a ballerina and a scientist for the department of energy. They spend the night in a hotel, drinking, and head out to the woods to search. They find some fishers in the woods who tell them that a girl in the 1800s left the village and appeared several days later at her grandmother’s, talking about a floating old woman. They make it into the woods and, laden with supplies, head towards Coffin Rock. When they arrive, Heather reads a story about five men bound and tortured found on Coffin Rock. The men who found them went to get the police, but when they returned, the bodies were gone. They set up their camp, and in the morning, Josh tells them that he heard a cackling during the night. Heather admits to them that they got a little lost, but she knows where they are now. They hike to find a trail and Mike complains that Heather is constantly getting them lost. They look at a map and Mike admits that he doesn’t trust her. They find a clearing with several piles of rocks and Josh accidentally knocks one over while filming. That night while sleeping, they hear movement in the woods and go to investigate but find nothing. They head back to the car and think they got lost again. They start arguing about where they are and where they’re going, Heather wants to camp but the others don’t want to, but they need to when it gets dark. Heather hears what she thinks is the same thing again that night and tries to investigate. Mike says it sounds like a person walking around in the woods. When they wake up in the morning, they find three piles of rocks that weren’t there the previous night. They find out that the map is missing and Josh says he gave her back the map accuses her of trying to make excuses to keep filming in the woods. After walking some more, Josh brings up that people will start looking for them if they don’t get home. Heather brings up the map again, arguing with them about where the map went, and Mike tells them that he kicked the map into the creek because it was useless. Heather and Josh yell at him for getting them lost. Josh yells at Heather because he felt she never knew where they were. They keep walking and Mike finds human figures made of sticks hanging from the trees. They leave the area and Heather admits that they’re lost. That night, they hear voices in the woods around them, including little kids, and something starts shaking the tent. They run out of the tent and Heather sees something in the woods. When the sun rises, they return to find the tent thrown around and Mike’s pack strewn around the camp and blue slime on some of Josh’s stuff. They head back into the woods, trying to find the car, and Josh and Mike start to lose their composure. They south all day and wind up back at a log that they had already crossed and all of them break down. The next day, Josh disappears, and after waiting for him to come back, they decide to keep going. They camp that night, still with no sign of Josh, but they hear him in the night, sounding like he’s hurt. They call for him but can’t find him. Heather thinks that whatever was messing with them knows that Josh is gone and is tormenting them. When they get out in the morning, they find a bundle of sticks tied with strips of Josh’s shirt, with a small pouch in the middle with hair, blood, and teeth. Heather freaks out, but they manage to put more distance in during the day. Heather apologizes to the camera for getting them lost and attacked and hears something out in the woods. They hear somebody calling in the distance and find a house when they investigate it, the roof collapsed, window broken. Mike goes into the house to look around despite Heather’s protests. Mike heads upstairs to find the source of the voice and they see handprints on the walls. Mike claims to hear Josh downstairs and goes down, Heather screaming after him. In the basement, the camera drops to the ground and Mike goes silent. Heather follows down and sees him standing against the wall before she goes silent, her camera dropping to the ground. </p>
  <h3><a id="thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <p>I love found footage movies, so I was very happy to see the start of the craze. Another one I should have seen a while ago, and I’m honestly very upset that I slept on it. The reactions of the three to being lost in the woods, cracking due to stress and hunger, was incredibly well done. The growing dread of the noises outside the tent and the items being left around the tent was great, building an extra layer of supernatural tension that permeates everything else. I loved this movie, but I think that they could have done a little more with the scares, the voices and the objects. A reveal isn’t necessary (though would have been appreciated) but a little more would have gone a long way. I don’t think that anything should be removed, but a few more horror elements would be great. </p>
