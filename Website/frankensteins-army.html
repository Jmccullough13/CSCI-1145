 <h4>2013</h4>
  <h3><a id="summary">Summary</a></h3>
  <p>An officer in the Russian army tells the camera that he’s been charged with filming a sqaud’s efforts against Nazi Germany on a battlefield. The men work their way through a battlefield and find a strange burnt skeleton, human yet inhuman, with sparks flickering in the ribcage. They find a farmhouse and raid it, taking their booze and chickens before moving on. They receive a signal from what sounds like another recon team in the area requesting help, but when they try to answer, they only hear the same request repeated, as if the other group can’t hear them. As they move on to the area in the message, the camera man finds a body with a metal plate on its arm and a bolt in its chin. It spasms a bit, yells, and its eye explodes before it stops moving again. When they get to the area, they find a strange tank with a massive gun on it but ignore it and move on. They find an attacked village and, next to a church, a pile of burnt nuns. While investigating the church, they find it converted into a factory. They turn on a generator to try and get light into the factory and find a body, hooked up to cables, stitched and outfitted with metal parts and a drill on its arms, that jerks to life when the electricity reaches it. It attacks the commanding officer of the group with the drill, disemboweling him, before they shoot it. As they regroup, they try to get another signal to headquarters and try to connect their device to a tower. A smaller group, with a sniper and heavy armsman, go into the town to find people and get answers. They hear something from one of the houses and go inside to investigate. They find some animals inside and a man, whom they shoot before taking prisoner to get answers. The man tells them that the people left the village to flee from things. The cameraman tells the others that he came with the group because he was charged to find a doctor in charge of some project. They cut the man’s finger off to make him talk and he agrees to lead them to the Russians that were in trouble. He takes them to a building and leads the way to a basement before disappearing. The group heads down a corridor and are attacked by a man with scythes for hands. A siren starts to go off as they kill the man and they try to run but are blocked by another person with large metal claws. Something with long limbs and a drill coming from its face chases them into a cage where something in a metal suit that clamps into the heavy armsman’s head. They make it out and get back to their camp in the church and the armsman dies after telling the new commanding officer that they were lured into a trap. They find others in the village and take them prisoners, demanding to know about the other Russians, but the leader of the group tells them that there are no other Russians and the villager were all killed by the things they were attacked by. They ask how many, and she tells them that she doesn’t know because more are made all the time. The drill faced thing kills the sniper and they try to shoot it, but the bullets bounce off of it. Other things come in and try to drag some of the men off, but they manage to make one of the things explode and they all escape into the lower area of the church/factory. They find a receiver in the cameraman’s bag that’s playing a recording of the distress call they received. He tells them that he’s a captain and that the government has a list of their families, that they will be killed if they leave without completing the mission, which is to capture or kill the doctor making the things. They find a bunker leading to the doctor’s lab but are attacked by the claw handed thing. They escape and find a furnace room with another thing with metal claws disposing of body parts into a furnace, including a small boy. They force the boy into a chute to do recon for them and the boy gets cut up by a propeller headed creature, which comes out and attacks the group. They cut a wire in its head and it explodes. The other men shove the captain and his filming equipment down the chute and leave, refusing to help him anymore. A creature comes in and takes his equipment and puts it on a conveyor, refusing to let him have it back, leaving him with only the camera. He makes his way to the doctor’s living quarters, where he sees a woman’s head on a teddy bear, alive, and a portrait with a coat of arm reading Frankenstein. He hears an alarm and follows it into a cold room where corpses are being stored for later use. A creature comes in and pushes a cart full of bodies into another room and the captain follows it, but he’s attacked by a creature in a diving suit. He runs, attracting the attention of many more of the creatures, including the drill faced one. He makes it out and finds the armsman already converted into a creature. It attacks and knocks him out, and when the camera comes back on, the captain is sitting at a table with Frankenstein forcing him to eat some kind of soup to make him strong. He wants the captain to make a record of his work. He leads the captain through his lab and explains that he changed his cats into cyborgs when he was a child and when he was captured by the Nazis, they employed him to do the same to humans. He used his grandfather’s notes, but instead of using lightning, he uses a generator. He shows the captain the generator that he uses and brings a creature to life. They hear a rumbling outside and the captain tells him that the Russian army is on its way to bomb his army and that they want him to work for them. Frankenstein wants to create a being that can help both sides understand each other and takes half of the brain out of a live Nazi, and using one of the Russians who escaped, combines the two halves of the brain into one being. Frankenstein tries to bring the being to life, but it fails. He then straps the captain to a table and prepares to put the camera into his head, but the army arrives and Frankenstein flees to evade capture, telling the captain that when he leaves, the creatures will turn on each other. The last soldier alive kills the doctor and takes the camera, leaving the two brained man to kill the captain. </p>
  <h3><a id="thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <p>Supposedly found footage, but doesn’t feel like it. It feels like they’re trying too hard to make it found footage, but the shots feel too steady and set and not in the slightest bit shaky, which they should have been is someone holding a camera was running. It felt like a first person view more than a camera filming. Also, this is supposedly during WWII. Why are Russians speaking purely in English? The acting isn’t great, on that note. One of the soldiers, a bully and clearly not Russian, kept slipping out of his Russian accent. Nothing happened for too long, and once the action started happening, it was constant shaky cams and nonsensical action that was very difficult to follow. The creatures were odd, mostly robots with some human parts to them and supposedly served some function, but it never seemed apparent what that function was. Most of them seemed to have no purpose outside of being scary. There was one scene where a scythe handed creature was literally just smacking its blade against a metal block, which has no purpose. And the woman head teddy bear made zero sense and was never explored. It was only there for some sort of shock factor and nothing more. Yes, the doctor was made to be insane, but there seemed to be a method to some of his insanity, at least. The best creature was the drill faced creature, which was actually chilling, but the rest seemed like zombies with weapons instead of hands. The effects were pretty good, all practical, at least, so they were enjoyable, but little else was. It was gory for shock factor, and it felt more like a video walkthrough of a “Haunted House” Halloween set up than an actual movie.</p>
