  <h3><a id="summary">Summary</a></h3>
  <p>A girl is running through the woods, chased by something. She gets to her room and a pale girl with black hair appears. She wakes up screaming, and her mother comes in to calm her down. After calming her down, she reads an account about an entity called the belle witch. In the past, a girl, Betsy, is being chased by Joshua, who tackles her to the ground and demands a kiss. Her sister helps her escape, and she goes home to get ready for a party. At the party, she is asked to dance by her teacher, which her father, John, disapproves of. That night, Betsy’s mother hears her crying and sees John missing from bed. She goes to check on her children and John finds her, telling her it’s coming from the attic. The noise stops, and John says it’s a witch trying to mess with him for the trial. The next day in trial, John is found guilty of breaking church law for overcharging a woman, Kate, for use of her land and a loan, though she wants the profit he earned for selling her wood. When Kate leaves, she threatens John and his family for his transgressions. The next day, while hunting, he has a vision where a black wolf is attacking him in the woods. He shoots it, but it comes back to attack him. That night, they hear the wolf again, and he and his son go to shoot it. Betsy hears it and looks out the window, and the wolf starts to scratch at her window. She hears footsteps in her room and sees the wolf under her bed. Her mother comes to get her and takes her out of the room, but John and his son come inside and send them to bed. The next day at school, Betsy sleeps through class. When at recess, she sees a small girl with a fuzzy face that no else can see. She reaches for Betsy’s hand, but when she touches it, she falls. Her friends tell her she can’t see the girl and she runs off, scared. That night, while patrolling around the house, John sees the figure of a woman in the yard. Something pulls Betsy’s covers off of her and when she tries to run, her door slams shut. Something invisible sits on her bed and pulls her hair. She screams for her mother and both she and her father come in to console her and tell her that it was a dream. John tells his wife that he saw someone on the roof and when they find some of Betsy’s hair, he storms off to Kate’s house to demand an answer, but his wife stops him. A family friend comes over the next night and reads some bible passages to try and protect their house. They think the house is safe, but Betsy’s attacked again, dragged across the floor by her hair and slapped before being raised into the air and attacked again. Her parents and their friend break in to see her and the thing drops her before shredding a pillow and breaking through a window. They go to talk to the teacher about what’s happening to Betsy and they try to find an answer to what happened, though the teacher tries to convince them that there was nothing supernatural about the attack, that one of Kate’s slaves is tormenting them. He agrees to stay in the house to show them he’s right. The next day, Joshua tries to get Betsy to go to the river with them and she shoves him, yelling at him. The teacher tells her it will pass. Later, she sees Joshua kissing another girl and gets angry. A book on her bed flips on its own to a page that says “remember”. The teacher is staying in the house, outside of Betsy’s door. The mother hears her door open and they both see her pinned to her bed, her hips bucking. John tries to get in to help her and the door hits him on the head. The door opens again and Betsy is sleeping normally. Later, in the parlor, while the teacher tries to rationalize what they saw, the fires all blow out and a bible is thrown across the room, pages scattering. The teacher tries to reason with the thing and it breaks through a window. John sees his tongue become gray and scabby in a mirror and it breaks. The next day, one of Kate’s slaves brings a bag to the house, saying it belongs to the Bells, and leaves. When they open it, they find clothes belonging to John and Betsy and one of the slaves tells the mother that it’s a witch’s trick to curse someone. At school, Joshua kicks a ball into the woods and Betsy goes after it. She sees the girl from before, who disappears with the ball. Betsy sees her further on and chases her, following after her into a cave with a small pool. They splash each other a bit before the girl looks up at her with a corpse’s face. She wakes up screaming, and her friend, staying over, calms her down. John tries to take a rifle to murder Kate and the mother calms him down again. Betsy and her friend hear something whisper Betsy’s name and they try to escape the room but something traps them inside. They spin around in a circle for some time before the friend tries to escape through the window. A candle stick flies at the friend and knocks her out. When they’re trying to get the story out of the friend, Betsy sits up and screams before laying back down. Her eyes roll back in her head and the windows start to open and shut. The thing goes around the room, calling everyone’s name, and when the teacher demands to know who it is, Betsy is dragged by her arms up the stairs and shoves the men down as they run after her. The teacher tells John that it’s attacking him as well, and that the best way to save them is to get them off of the property, thinking the entity is only on the property. Betsy’s brother and the teacher take Betsy away and the entity searches the house for Betsy, and when it doesn’t find her, it launches out into the woods and knocks a tree over in their path, destroying their carriage. It kicks up a strong wind and a wolf attacks Betsy’s brother while the teacher takes her away on horseback. The wolf chases them and knocks the horse over. Betsy wakes up and her mother tells her she was never sent away. The teacher and the mother talk about his feelings for Betsy and the mother begs him to marry to Betsy to protect her, but he refuses because it wouldn’t be fair to Betsy. After that, the entity attacks John more than Betsy, leaving Betsy catatonic and allowing no one to help her. The mother, sitting in a swing, has a dream that Betsy dies before waking to hear Betsy calling for help. She checks on Betsy and sees a figure in her room before waking up back in the swing she was sitting in before. John goes to Kate’s house and hands her a pistol, begging her to end the curse. She tells him she put no curse on them and that he did it himself. John goes to a clearing to shoot himself but the shot doesn’t go off. The entity tries to tell Betsy to remember something and she has a flashback of John molesting her in much the same way that she way being attacked by the entity before. He takes her bloodstained nightgown and puts it into a bag to throw away. The entity tells Betsy that it was born by the merging of innocence and evil from what John did to her. Betsy gives something to John while he’s sleeping while he mother watches from a chair nearby. Betsy stands by John’s grave and sees the girl change from corpse-like to herself. The entity doesn’t bother her again. Back in the present, the girl is leaving to stay with her father for the weekend. The mother sees Betsy’s ghost who tells her to help her daughter. She runs out of the house and chases after the car.</p>
  <h3><a id="thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <p>The camera angles are more fantastical than horror, turning and drifting along instead of cutting. There were bad fades for scene transitions. Honestly, the whole movie reminded me more of <u>Hocus Pocus</u> or a kid movie with fantastical horror elements more than an actual horror movie. This, in fact, was not a horror movie. There was little actual drama set up in terms of tension for horror to scare the audience. The most horror we got was jump scares and terrible CGI. The entire story was a cautionary tale, heavy handed in the execution of repressed memories of assault where it could have been much more subtle. I’ve seen something along these same lines but executed much better, and while it wasn’t necessarily a horror movie, it was a much better movie. I understand where they’re coming from and what they’re aiming for, but it wasn’t handled well. The climax, where she realized what had happened to her, was a letdown, done with some poison rather than anything more satisfying, and the only but of closure we see is her “other self” turning back to an innocent girl and a picture of her marrying the teacher. The movie wasn’t too long, so they could have easily spent a little more time showing her closure and moving on with her life. On a fun note, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000651/">Sissy Spacek</a>, the actress who played the original Carrie, played the modern-day mother, so we get a fun mix of Carrie’s actress mixed with a girl using psychic powers to torment her tormentors. Honestly, that was the most fun thing. The acting wasn’t great from anyone but <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000661/">Donald Sutherland</a>, who was pretty good as John, showing subtlety in his acting instead of being incredibly wooden like the teacher or Betsy’s mother. Betsy herself was a pretty decent physical actress, as well. The music was too whimsical to fit into a horror movie, and not a great choice. Overall, I’d rather watch movies in the same vein as this one, such as <u>Sleepy Hollow</u> or <u>Hocus Pocus</u>.</p>
