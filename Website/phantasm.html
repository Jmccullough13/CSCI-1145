 <h4>1979</h4>
  <h3><a id="summary">Summary</a></h3>
  <p>A couple is having a romantic encounter on a grave and the woman stabs the man. Jody and Reggie meet at a mortuary home to see off their old friend Tommy, the man stabbed in the graveyard. While Jody is examining his parents’ grave inside the mausoleum, he hears something making noises and goes to investigate but is stopped when the mortician gets him for the funeral. After they put the casket to rest, Michael sees the mortician lifting the casket on his own into the hearse. When he tries to leave, he crashes. He goes to a psychic and tells her that Jody, his brother, is leaving and is going to leave him with relatives. The psychic and her granddaughter play a small prank on him to teach him about fear and then laugh at him. Jody goes to a bar, meets the same woman who killed Tommy, and she leads him to the cemetery where Tommy died. While they’re making out on a grave, Michael is attacked by a creature in a hooded robe and runs screaming. Jody chases after him and sends him home, but when he goes to find the girl, she’s gone. Michael has a nightmare about the mortician, and when he’s in town the next day, he sees the mortician sniffing the air around Reggie. That night, while working under Jody’s car, Michael is trapped under the car by one of the robed creatures. Jody doesn’t believe him, so he goes to the cemetery and breaks into the funeral parlor. While wandering around, he’s grabbed by a man as a metal ball with a blade flies at him. He bites the man’s arm and breaks free and the ball digs into the man’s face, spewing blood out the other side. As the man dies, the mortician appears. Michael flees and shuts a heavy door on the man’s hand, cutting the fingers off as yellow liquid pours out. The fingers are still moving and Michael takes it before being chased out by the robed creatures. He shows Jody the finger and he agrees to go to the police, but the finger has changed into a giant fanged insect that attacks them both. Jody gives Michael a shotgun to defend himself with and goes to the parlor to confront the mortician. When he arrives, he’s attacked by a robed creature and escapes as the mortician drives to run him down with the hearse. Michael arrives with the car and drive off, chased by the hearse. They manage to shoot out the engine and it runs into a tree. They find one of the robed creatures impaled on tree branch and remove the hood to find that it looks like Tommy. They theorize that the mortician is doing something with the bodies and wonder about their parents. Reggie helps them take the creature and away and he and Jody send Michael to some friends to keep him safe. He sees the mortician in some old photos in an antique store and demands to go home. On the way, they find Reggie’s truck crashed, the creature gone. Before they can flee, the creature attacks, and Michael is shoved out of the car as it takes off, disappearing into the darkness. He makes his way home but is trapped in his room by Jody to keep him in. He escapes by blowing a hole in his door with a hammer and a shotgun shell and tries to go after Jody, but the mortician is waiting for him outside of his house. The mortician is taking Michael to the parlor, but he escapes and causes the car to run into a pole, exploding. He makes his way into the parlor and checks on their parents’ bodies to find the caskets empty. He’s attacked by a sphere and Jody shoots it down before they’re joined by Reggie, who’s been hiding in a casket. They make their way to a locked room and find chambers creating the robed creatures. Michael finds a portal to another planet and falls through, where he sees the creatures carrying the chambers across a red landscape. Jody pulls him back in before he can fall completely through and as Michael’s telling them what he saw, the lights go out. Michael is attacked by a creature, Jody is ejected from the building, and Reggie finds himself alone in the portal room. He touches the device creating the portal, turning it off, and causes it to start pulling everything in around it. He escapes outside, but it stabbed by the woman from the beginning, who turns into the mortician. Jody and Michael escape after finding Reggie just as the parlor is pulled through the portal. They make a plan to drop the mortician into a mineshaft, but while Jody’s preparing the trap, the mortician attacks Michael at their house. He manages to lead the mortician to the mine shaft and Jody traps him in the shaft with boulders. Michael suddenly wakes up in bed. Later, he’s telling Reggie about his dream. Reggie tells him that he shouldn’t worry too much after Jody died in a car crash. They make plans to go on a road trip to clear his mind, and as he’s gathering his things, the mortician appears in his room and he’s pulled through a mirror by one of the creatures.</p>
  <h3><a id="thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <p>This movie had great music. The theme played a lot, but I felt that it matched the scenes it played in, so it didn’t feel overplayed. The camera cut, though, were terrible. One scene had camera cuts for every line spoken and it felt very much like whiplash. The acting was terrible, but the fortune teller’s granddaughter was the absolute worst. Thankfully, she only had two scenes. Michael stalked Jody everywhere and it was so creepy, though it did result in the funniest scene in the movie, which I feel was unintentional. However creepy Michael was, he was also the smartest character in the movie by far. Jody kept trying to abandon him and go after a monster with no idea what he was up against, but Michael kept trying to make a plan. Also, when he broke out of room with the hammer and shotgun shell was damn genius. The effects were great too, but there weren’t enough of them. There were too many shots of Jody doing nothing but staring ahead, but perhaps it was foreshadowing for him being dead all along? The ending was…odd…I didn’t like that it was all a dream. I hate those endings, it also feels like it cheapens the entire story</p>
