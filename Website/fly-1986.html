 <h4>1986</h4>
  <h3><a id="summary">Summary</a></h3>
  <p>Veronica is interviewing Seth Brundle about his scientific achievements, and he offers to take her to his lab to show her. He gets her to his lab and starts playing piano, making her feel like she made a mistake, but he powers on his telepods and gives her a demonstration. She gives him her stocking to use in the demonstration and teleports it to the other pod. She tries to record quotes about it and he demands the tape, not knowing he was talking to a journalist. Veronica plays the tape for her boss, Stathis, who thinks it’s a joke. Seth arrives to try and talk her out of talking to people and tells her that it’s not ready, that it can’t teleport organic matter. He convinces her to make him her project, to watch his project and follow it to completion, to be the one to break the story to the world. She gets home and finds Stathis in her shower and they talk about Brundle’s accomplishments, that he’s close to winning the nobel. With Veronica filming, Seth tries to teleport a baboon, but it teleports inside out. Seth blames himself for not knowing enough about biology. They have a romantic evening, and Veronica says something that stirs in his mind and the next morning, he successfully teleports a steak, but it tastes synthetic. Seth thinks he’s figured out the flesh problem. While at a store, Stathis confronts Veronica about her involvement with Seth, getting jealous, but she shrugs him off. Seth manages to successfully teleport a baboon and Veronica wants to go on a trip to celebrate. While making dinner plans, she finds a package from Stathis on Seth’s piano, a cover of the magazine she works for with his picture on it. She confronts Stathis about trying to take the story from her and gets him to back down. Seth gets upset, realizing that Stathis is her old boyfriend, and drinks heavily while talking to the baboon. He decides to teleport himself, but a fly gets into the telepod with him. Veronica comes back and they celebrate his success together. When she gets up in the morning, she finds him performing gymnastic feats on a bar that he couldn’t before. He theorizes that the process of being taken apart enhances and purifies the body while pouring tons of sugar into his coffee. Later, while making love, she feels coarse hairs on his back, and his face has become splotchy. He tries to get her to go through, to become like him, but she refuses, saying she’s scared, and is worried that something went wrong for him. He leaves, saying she’s not good enough to stand with him anymore, and leaves to find someone who can. He keeps eating candy bars while he’s out. He finds a bar and starts chatting to a woman, but some men don’t like that and tell him to leave. He challenges one of them to arm wrestling and breaks his arm, snapping the bone through the wrist. He takes the woman home and tries to get her to go through the teleporter with him, but she refuses, afraid. Veronica arrives, stopping him from forcing her to go through. She says she took the hairs that were on his back to a lab and they found them to be close to insect hairs. Seth lashes out at her and shoves her out. Seth finds hair on his face and tries to shave them off can’t, and his fingernail falls off. White liquid squirts from his finger and the rest of his fingernails start coming out too. He looks at the records from the first teleportation and finds that a fly went through with him, bonding to his DNA. Four weeks later, Seth calls Veronica to tell her he’s gotten far, far worse. She goes to see him and he tells her about the fly and that he’s dying, thinking he’s cancerous. His apartment is filled with sweets and as he picks one up, he spews some liquid onto it and his ear falls off. She tries to get help from Stathis but he refuses, telling her to stay away from him, but agrees to try and help if he can see Seth. She goes back to see Seth and finds him crawling on the ceiling and in better spirits about his condition, that he’s becoming something new. Veronica films him spewing liquid on his food and sucking it back up, like a fly. She shows Stathis the video and then finds out she’s pregnant. Seth, his change much worse, tries to run a test to see if he can reduce the amount of fly in him by fusing himself with another human. Veronica comes by to tell that she’s pregnant, but can’t, and Seth tells her to leave because he’s becoming more insect and he doesn’t want to hurt her. Veronica demands to have an abortion to Stathis, and Seth, going outside to see her one last time, overhears her. They go to a doctor to get an abortion and Seth breaks in, taking her outside, and begs her not to kill the baby because it might be all that’s left of the real him. Stathis breaks into Seth’s lab with a gun but is ambushed by Seth, who spews onto his hand, reducing it to a broken nub. Stathis tries to get the gun again, and Seth spews on his leg, severing his foot. Veronica stops him from killing Stathis. Seth tries to get her to splice with him in the pods and rips off his jaw, which seems to force a quick transformation into a full hybrid Brundlefly. He forces her into a pod and moves to get in one himself, but as the sequencing is about to start, Stathis shoots through the cables. Brundlefly smashes his way out of the pod, but the sequencing happens anyway, fusing him with parts of the pod. Veronica picks up the gun but can’t shoot him until Brundlefly points the barrel at his own face. Veronica shoots his head off and falls to the ground, crying.</p>
  <h3><a id="thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <p>This was another movie I had seen before, but another I wanted a second pass at. I remember it being better than it was, but I might have been remembering the effects, which were amazing. All prosthetics or puppets and animatronics. <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000156/">Jeff Goldblum</a> was just Ian Malcolm in this movie, too, so I wonder if he could play another character. All of the mannerisms were the same as in <u>Jurassic Park</u>. <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000133/">Geena Davis</a> was the better actor, I felt, until Goldblum got into the transformation phase, and then he shined! He was perfect at acting insect-like, adding fly-like mannerisms. My biggest complaint about this movie, and what really knocked it down in my estimation, was the plot. We had no real sense of how much time passed, except in Brundle’s transformations, that I couldn’t see why Veronica was so attached to Seth that she would keep coming back to try and help, especially after he acted like an asshole to her before he started sliding downhill. Time must have passed for them to be so close, but I didn’t feel it. Overall a great movie, but the plot could have been tightened up, and not nearly as good as the <a href="fly-1958.html">original</a>. </p>
