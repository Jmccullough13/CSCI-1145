 <h4>2015</h4>
  <h3><a id="summary">Summary</a></h3>
  <p>In a trial, a man is accused of breaking the laws of a Puritan commonwealth village while he proclaims only to be preaching the gospels, exercising his religious freedoms that they left England for. He and his family are banished from the village. They make a homestead in a plain amongst a forest. Thomasin, the oldest daughter, prays for forgiveness for her sins. The family is bringing in harvest for the fall while Thomasin looks after her newborn brother. While playing peekaboo, the baby disappears, and Thomasin heads into the woods to try and find him, following his cries. A naked figure strokes the baby before raising a knife to it. The same figure is churning something bloody within a butter churn, and rubs the churned material on a staff. A week later, the oldest son, Caleb, rises to go hunting with his father while Thomasin helps with her younger siblings and chores around the stead because the mother has kept to bed praying and weeping. While hunting a rabbit, the musket ignites poorly and injures the father’s eye. They return and find a black male goat out of his pen, with two of the younger children chasing it about the yard. The father returns and gets it into its pen and the mother emerges from the house and they both yell at Thomasin for not watching the children better and make her wash their clothes. While she is, one of the younger children, Mercy, accuses her of allowing a witch to steal the baby, and Thomasin tells her that she’s the witch the scare her and keep her from bothering her. At dinner, the mother accuses Thomasin of losing a silver cup, and when sheep start bleating, they force Thomasin to go check on them. She sees the same rabbit that was hunted in the barn with the sheep. That night, the parents discuss their fortunes on the farm and the mother accuses him of killing them because they left the village and wants to send Thomasin to work for a family in the village. All four children hear this. Caleb takes the horse and goes into the woods early the next morning, and Thomasin finds him, demanding to help or she’ll tell the parents. They find animals in their traps, but see the same rabbit in the woods. Their dog takes off after it, spooking the horse. Caleb runs after the dog and the horse throws Thomasin, knocking her out. When she comes to, it’s dark and her parents are calling for them. She finds them but there’s no sign of Caleb. Caleb gets lost in the woods and finds the dog, dead. He makes his way through the woods, finding and following the rabbit, and finds a hut in the woods. A beautiful woman in a red cloak emerges and pulls him to her, reaching for him with a whithered crone’s hand. At the house, the mother demands for Thomasin to tell why they went into the woods, and the father tells her he took the cup to sell for money and that he was going to find Caleb. To calm her, Thomasin goes to check on the goats, who are bleating again, and finds Caleb leaning against the fence, naked. They bring him and put him to rest, thinking him sick. The younger kids accuse Thomasin of being a witch and cursing Caleb, which she refutes, but gets upset when she milks the goat and nothing but blood comes out. The father and mother discuss what’s ailing him and she brings up witchcraft, which he denies, and he tells her that they’ll go to the village the next day. They go out to the fields to find more corn but return when Caleb screams and wakes up. He babbles nonsense and throws up an apple, which immediately sets the mother on the thought of witchcraft again. The younger kids immediately accuse Thomasin of being a witch, which the father takes very seriously and demands to know the truth. Caleb wakes up again and starts babbling about a lady lord. The father makes them pray for him, but the children stop, claiming to have forgotten the words. Caleb stops talking and lays still, dead. The mother demands that Thomasin leave and she does, the father chasing after her. He tries to console her and then demands that she confess to the witchcraft to save her soul. She refuses and calls him a hypocrite. She tells him that the younger kids are talking to the black goat and that Satan can take the form of a black goat and that Mercy called herself a witch. The father drags them all back inside and confronts the children, demanding a confession from them. They play asleep, but when he grabs one, they start screaming. He takes them all into the barn and boards them in, vowing to take them to the village in the morning, and buries Caleb. At night, he admits in prayer that this is his fault because he was too prideful and begs forgiveness. The mother wakes in the middle of the night to see Caleb holding the baby in the corner of the bedroom. She wants to wake the father, but Caleb stops her. In the barn, the children hear footsteps and see a crone suckling on their goat. They scream, waking Thomasin. The mother, thinking she’s nursing the baby, is being pecked by a crow. When the father wakes in the morning, he finds the barn destroyed, the goats dead, and Thomasin lying unconscious in the middle of it. The black goat charges him and gores him with its horn. He tries to take an axe to it, but the goat charges him again, knocking him into a wood pile and spilling it on top of him, killing him. The mother comes out and attacks Thomasin, thinking her responsible. She tries to strangle Thomasin, who grabs a knife and uses it on her. Thomasin goes into the house to clean herself up and mourn her family, and she falls asleep at the family table. When she wakes up, it’s dark, and she leaves the house to go back to the barn. She sees the black goat go into the barn and follows it, demanding that it speak to her as it spoke to Mercy. She hears a voice asking what she wants, and if she would like to live deliciously. She says yes, and the voice tell her to sign her name in a book before her, the goat transitioning into a man in black clothes and telling her she can guide her hand when she says she can’t write. She walks into the woods, naked, the goat following, and she comes across a small group of women thrashing and chanting in front of a fire. They begin to rise into the air, and she follows, beaming happily.</p>
  <h3><a id="thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <p>I wasn’t quite sure what to expect with this movie, and it delivered on the confusion. I don’t know how historically accurate this movie is, but I wholeheartedly think that the religious and daily life aspects of the movie were believable enough. When the witch accusations began to fly, I got massive “Crucible” flashbacks, though this movie was at least more entertaining than any version of that play that I’ve seen. That poor Thomasin got the short end of every stick, and I honestly feel she deserved to break free at the end, though not necessarily through the trauma of losing her entire family. The acting was pretty good in this movie, even for the child actors. The lighting was fantastic for having shot in a clearing along some woods. The music was a bit overdone, though, only being used to signal something bad happening, as if we couldn’t use our own eyes to tell that. It would have been better without music at all. Not a bad watch, but not necessarily needing a second viewing. </p>
