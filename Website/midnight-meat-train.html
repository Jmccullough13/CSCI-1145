  <h3><a id="summary">Summary</a></h3>
  <p>A man wakes up in a subway car and gets up to leave but finds the floor slick with blood. In the next car, he sees another man, Mahogany, beating a body with a meat tenderizer. A photographer, Leon, tired of chasing police cars to sell photos to news outlets, gets an interview at an art gallery, but the director thinks that his work is lacking and tells him to look harder at the city, at its heart, which he claims is his dream. That night, he has a dream about a bloody subway car and goes to take pictures of the city at night. He follows three men into a subway and finds them trying to mug a woman. He intervenes, showing them a security camera, and they leave. The woman gets onto a car with Mahogany who, when she puts headphones on, takes out a meat tenderizer and smashes her head with it. The next morning, he sees her photo in the newspaper as a missing person and takes his pictures to the police as evidence but they tell him it doesn’t mean much and suspect him of stalking. He takes the pictures to the gallery director and she tells him she likes them and wants some more to hire him. He celebrates with his friend, Jurgis, and his girlfriend, Maya, but leaves to try and get his two more shots. Two men and a woman are talking on a train and Mahogany attacks them. Leon sees Mahogany coming up the escalator from the subway and follows him, but Mahogany catches him and stops him from following. When looking at shots he’s already taken, he sees Mahogany in several others, including one with the missing woman as she got on the train. Leon decides to follow Mahogany around the city, taking pictures of him, into a meat packing facility, where Mahogany works. Leon waits for him afterward and follows him into the subway, where he sits on a bench for hours until he gets onto a train. Leon tries to follow him but is stopped by an officer wanting to make sure his camera is a camera. On the train, Mahogany attacks a large man in camo and tries to kill him with the hammer, but stops with pain in his stomach, allowing the camo man to attack him. They fight, getting the attention of the train driver, who comes back and shoots camo man in the head before telling Mahogany he’s disappointed in him. Mahogany goes home and, in the bathroom, sees a series of growths on his shoulder and chest. He cuts one off, puts it in a jar, and takes some pain pills. Maya tries to tell Leon to stop following the man and take other pictures, but Leon ignores her and, after finding articles in previous decades linking missing people to butchers, sneaks into the meat packing plant where Mahogany works to try and get more pictures. Mahogany sees him and chases Leon through the plant with a knife. Leon escapes and puts together a map of missing people reports, finding them to be related and that the butchers all worked at the same meat packing plant. Maya sees his reports and begs him to stop, insisting he takes pictures of her instead, but as he does, he sees flashes of the meat packing plant and the missing woman. Maya leaves, and after he collects himself, he goes to apologize to her at her workplace but sees Mahogany watching him through the window. Leon follows Mahogany onto a train. Mahogany pulls out the hammer and pauses, checking to see if Leon is still nearby, before attacking the two people left on the train. Leon hides, but takes pictures of Mahogany killing them, dissecting their bodies, and hanging them up to drain their blood. Mahogany catches him and chases him through the train, knocking him out against a window. Leon wakes up, strung upside down from the top of the car and undefined creatures, dark and slimy, start pawing at him. He passes out, and wakes up in a basement below the meat packing plant, unharmed except the forehead wound. When he gets home, he finds a symbol scratched into his chest. Maya finds him and tells him to get the pictures to the police, he tells her that Mahogany took his camera. While he goes to sleep, Maya and Jurgis break into Mahogany’s apartment to find Leon’s camera to get the proof, but Mahogany returns and kills Jurgis as he finds the camera. Maya finds subway schedules from eras past and flees when she realizes Mahogany is back. Maya goes to the police but they tell her they could arrest her for breaking and entering. At the gallery exhibit, Leon sees a picture of Mahogany and leaves, heading to the midnight train. Maya takes her employer’s gun to hunt for Jurgis on her own, but when she leaves, the officer tries to stop her, wearing a necklace that matches a ring that Mahogany wears. She tells Maya that Jurgis is on a specific train and she goes to get on the train. Leon goes to the butcher shop, loads up on blades, and heads into the basement below the plant, waiting for the train. Maya goes through the train, looking for Mahogany, and as it goes past the station, he sees Maya in the train and jumps on. Maya finds Jurgis among other bodies tied to the top of the car and Jurgis wakes up. She tries to pull him down and catches Mahogany’s attention. She tries to shoot him, but he knocks her down and as he’s about to hit her with the hammer, Leon stops him. They fight amongst the bodies, Mahogany getting the upper hand for most of the fight, but Leon gets the hammer and manages to knocks Mahogany off of the train. The train stops in a deep underground cavern and the creatures get on to take the bodies away. Maya and Leon escape off of the train before they get on and find themselves in a large cave. Mahogany shows up and they fight again. Leon sees the same symbol that was on his chest on Mahogany’s chest before stabbing him through the neck with a leg bone. Mahogany tells him “Welcome” before he dies. The conductor tells Leon that Mahogany lacked what it took for the job before ripping Leon’s tongue out and eating it. He tells Leon that the things they serve were there long before humanity and this is what needs to be done for order to be kept. He kills Maya and commands Leon to serve as they all serve. Leon suits up in Mahogany’s old apartment and heads onto the train with the bag, pausing at the door of the train by a couple before pulling out the hammer.</p>
  <h3><a id="thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <p>This was based on a short story by <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000850/">Clive Barker</a>, one I’ve read, so I was somewhat looking forward to this movie, but all I can say is meh. The story didn’t revel too much in the gore, it just stated what happened to the bodies. It wasn’t descriptive any more than a description of a butcher shop would be. But of course, someone wanted an excuse to make a gory movie to compete with the other torture porn movies of the time, so why not one that includes meat train in its name? The camera work was decent, the acting from the main characters was ok with the exception of Maya, who overacted more often than not. The extras all chewed the scenery far too much, though not <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001637/">Vincent Price</a> levels of scenery chewing.  The character of Leon himself was stupid beyond belief. He made himself more than obvious while taking pictures, as if he was asking to be caught at any and all times. He knows no subtlety and earned nothing but scorn from me. A better movie could have been made, but this was not it. </p>
