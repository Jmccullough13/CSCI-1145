  <h3><a id="summary">Summary</a></h3>
  <p>Jonathan Harker is going to Dracula’s castle to help finish a land deal and is warned off by many, many people. He is dropped off in the middle of nowhere and a carriage is sent by Dracula to pick him up. Wolves surround the carriage and the driver gets down to scare them off. Dracula not seen in mirror. They speak of why Dracula wants to move. Three women emerge from coffins and converge on Jonathan, but Dracula pushes them away. Jonathan wakes up in his bed and finds marks on his neck that hadn’t been there before. He tries to escape through the window and finds empty crates before finding a stone casket with Dracula inside. He jumps out a window and recounts to Professor Van Helsing and Dr. Seward that he had been chased out of the castle by Dracula and the women as giant bats. Another patient in the hospital, Renfield, is getting upset and sees that someone has bought an abandoned house near the hospital. Mina and Lucy go to visit Jonathan and Lucy faints, prompting them to stay the night. Lucy is called out by a disembodied voice beyond the gates of the hospital and Mina follows her to the old house Renfield had seen before and sees her attacked by a man who disappears. Her fiancé Quincy Morris arrives and agrees to give her a blood transfusion. Lucy is called again and opens the window for Dracula. She reaches for him and is bitten again, passes out. Renfield starts screaming again and Van Helsing explains his situation. Renfield sees Dracula and escapes. Dracula appears at Lucy’s bed side again and feeds again and kills her before being seen by Mina. Van Helsing exposits about vampires. Lucy rises as a vampire and lures a child to be fed on. Ven Helsing finds out and goes to visit her grave and stake her and cut off her head. Seward, Quincy and Jonathan go after Dracula in his house and Mina visits Renfield. Van Helsing has a stroke. Taxidermy animals in the house come to life and attack the men and Dracula appears and orders Renfield to kill Mina. Jonathan holds up a cross and stops the attack and they sanctify the house so he can’t return to it. Mina is lured to the opera by Dracula and is attacked. Dracula hires a ship to return home. Jonathan and Quincy race Dracula back to his castle, kills the brides, sanctify his castle, and burn the count in his coffin as he arrives at the castle. </p>
  <h3><a id="thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <p>This is yet another movie with <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000489/">Christopher Lee</a> as Dracula, but with two differences: It is not in the same series as the <a href="horror-of-dracula.html">previous</a> <a href="dracula-prince-of-darkness.html">Dracula</a> movies on this list, and he has lines! That most exciting news out of the way…This movie was bad. I wanted it to be better, because it was a closer adaptation of the Bram Stoker <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dracula">novel</a>, but it wasn’t. The camera work was terrible with all tension being forced by dramatic camera zoom-ins and -outs in almost every scene while the people didn’t move through entire movement of the camera. Much of it was dubbed, or the audio very poorly matched up with the video. There was plenty of day for night shots, where they put a filter on a camera filing in daylight and pretend its night. The wolves were wolves, but dogs. Many noises were dubbed in, such as metal creaks, and they went on for too long. There were few sets, though they weren’t overdone, so I appreciated that. Just as with previous vampire to bat transformation, the bats in the movie were on a string, and it was so bad that they sometimes flew sideways! They don’t show Jonathan escaping the castle, he just has and they tell us about it later. Fortunately, the music wasn’t terrible. It was quiet and subdued when needed, loud and dramatic where needed. I stopped caring when, learning that Mina ad been lured to the opera under false pretenses, they had to rush to her, but only after changing into their finest opera finery…I don’t know if it’s stupid or good attention to historical context, but it lost me</p>
