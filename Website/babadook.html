  <h3><a id="summary">Summary</a></h3>
  <p>A woman, Amelia, is awakened by her son, Samuel, who had a bad dream. She reads him a book to get him to fall asleep, but when he does, he grabs onto her neck, which irritates her. The next morning, she awakens to him making a catapult to fight off the monsters, accidentally breaking a window. Later, he tries to hug her too hard and she has to pry him off of her. While she’s at work, she’s called into his school because he brought a crossbow. The school wants to hire a monitor to watch him, but she refuses and takes him out of the school. At the park, while she’s talking to her sister, Samuel climbs to the top of the swing set, constantly calling her name, until he’s on the top of the bars. He falls off, screaming her name, and they go home. That night, she reads him a book she’s never seen before called Mister Babadook. The book scares Samuel and he screams himself to sleep. The book has no publishing information and half of it is empty. She puts the book on top of a wardrobe before going to bed. Samuel comes in and tells her that the Babadook is in his room. She lets him fall asleep in her bed and later, she hears something coming from his room. She takes him to her sister’s house the next day while she goes to work. One of her coworkers tries to hit on her, but she ignores it. When she leaves, she has calls from her sister that Samuel has been scaring his cousin with stories about the Babadook. While cooking dinner, he’s messing around in the basement with his deceased father’s things and she catches him, yelling at him for not listening when she tells him to stay out of the basement. At dinner, she finds glass in her bowl but none in Samuel’s and he insists that the Babadook did it. She finds her bed things thrown all over her room and her favorite picture of her and her husband scribbled on. Samuel insists the Babadook did it. While sitting up and watching for monsters, Samuel sees his wardrobe fall over and scream. Amelia finds him under his bed and the Babadook book sitting on top of it. She rips the book up and puts it in the garbage. The next day, she and Samuel go to his cousin’s birthday party where she’s pitied by her sister’s friends and her niece calls Samuel names and makes fun of him for his father being dead. He pushes her out of a tree house, and on the way home, has a convulsion in the car. She takes him to the doctor to get some tests run on him and gets a sedative prescribed for him. The next morning, someone knocks on the door, then bangs on it, and she finds the book on her doorstep, the pages put back together with new ones added in showing her getting possessed and killing her dog, Samuel, and herself. She burns the book and the gets a call from someone with a raspy voice saying “Babadook.” She goes to the police and sees clawed gloves and a cloak behind the policeman and flees. At home, she sees a parade of roaches coming from a hole in the wall behind her fridge and cleans them up. Some people from a CPS equivalent come to talk to her about Samuel, and when they leave, she sees there’s no hole in the wall. That night, she hears scraping coming from outside her door and something slip inside her room. She hides under her covers, but when she comes back out, she sees the creature from the book crawling over the ceiling. It drops down and into her mouth. She takes Samuel out to sleep in the living room, though she gets no sleep. The next day, she call off work and goes to sleep, and when Samuel comes in to ask for breakfast, she snaps at him. She tries to find him later and apologize to him, promising to take him out for breakfast. On the way home, the Babadook appears to her on top of her car and scrabbles over it, causing her to crash into someone else. When they get home, he tries to go to bed early, but she refuses to let him, telling him the medication won’t work if he does. She falls asleep, but when she wakes up, she hears him calling someone for help and snatches the phone from him, snapping at him again and using a knife to cut the phone cord. Samuel takes the dog and they hide in his room. She has a dream where her husband is alive in the basement but demands that she bring Samuel to him in an increasingly raspy voice. She flees upstairs and sees the Babadook coming towards her in the kitchen. She runs into her bedroom and the Babadook drops onto her from the ceiling. When she comes to, she’s sitting in front of the TV, the dog comes down and she attacks it, snapping its neck. She heads upstairs to get Samuel next, floating across the room towards him, but he escapes and hides. When she finds him, she tries to play nice, apologizing, but 8he stabs her in the leg and runs to his room. When she breaks in, he attacks her with his weapons and runs into the basement, where he trips her and ties her to the floor. She breaks free and tries to strangle him, but stops herself and vomits up black sludge. She and Samuel leave the basement and head to her room, but darkness overtakes the room, and her husband appears, repeating what he said the day he died. She falls to her knees, screaming, and a large winged creature takes his place. She stands up and demands that it never touches her son again and yells it into submission. It flees into the basement, locking itself in. Several days later, her leg has healed, they’ve found a new school for Samuel, and things are going better for them. Amelia takes a bowl of worms into the basement, where she’s attacked again by the creature, but she calms it into submission and leaves.</p>
  <h3><a id="thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <p>This was a good movie, I will not lie. The acting was great. The shots were great, the writing was great. But I abhor this movie. I hate allegories using horror imagery in the way that this movie did. I hate how the kid seemed to know exactly what was going on with her, as if the creature was real and not an allegory for the darkness and depression inside her. And I hate what the child had to go through for this. I watch movies for an escape and don’t need to be reminded what people can and do deal with on a daily basis, with a sugar coating of a “monster” to make it easier to deal with. Everything about this movie from a production standpoint is absolutely amazing, but this script can burn. I hate this movie and will never watch it again.</p>
