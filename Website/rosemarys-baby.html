 <h4>1967</h4>
  <h3><a id="summary">Summary</a></h3>
  <p>Young couple Rosemary and Guy touring a new apartment. The realtor finds a blocked linen closet, confusing them. An old friend, Hutch, tells them about malicious doings in that building they were touring, including witchcraft and baby mutilation, to try and dissuade them, but they take the new apartment, conceiving a child. Rosemary meets Terry, a neighbor, in the laundry room and they talk about the previous tenant. That night, they hear chanting from the apartment next to theirs. They find Terry dead in the street by apparent suicide. The older couple who she lived with come by the scene and chat with the couple. The old lady neighbor comes by to talk and invites them to dinner. The old man butters up Guy with compliments on his acting. The old woman barges into Guy and Rosemary’s apartment and gives her same necklace as Terry had. The next day, Guy gets part he had been passed over for. To celebrate, they have a fancy dinner at home, and the old woman brings them mousse for dessert. Rosemary feels faint after eating a drugged desert and she passes out in bed before having a series of bizarre dreams, followed by a scene where she is surrounded by a bunch of old people, including their neighbors, all naked, and she is tied down and forced upon by a dark and strange creature. In the morning, she finds scratches and Guy claims he made them. She soon finds out she’s pregnant, and the old couple force a doctor who’s a friend of theirs on her. Rosemary starts acting strangely, becoming thin and gaunt and complains of pains and aches. Hutch calls her and wants to meet her, but when she goes out to meet him, she finds he’s suddenly in a coma. She tries to plan a party for old friends and tries to make sure that the old couple doesn’t come in. Everyone is commenting on her appearance and tries to give her advice about the baby, especially because of the pains and her appearance. When she says she’s getting a second opinion from another doctor about the pains, Guy yells at her and tries to convince her not to go to another doctor. She’s adamant, but as the pain finally stops, she gives in. Time passes and the baby’s arrival is imminent. Hutch passes away, leaving Rosemary a book with a message he had wanted to share with her, telling her that the old man’s name is an anagram for the name of a prominent satanist’s son. Guy blows her off when she tries to tell him, claiming that it’s bullshit. Rosemary demands that the old couple keep away from her and the baby, and they suddenly decide to go on vacation before the baby is born. Guy throws the book from Hutch away, driving Rosemary to do more research. She finds that the Satanists could have been behind the attacks on Hutch and the person Guy got the part from. Rosemary packs a bag and goes to see her doctor and finds out that he is probably part of the same group as the old couple. She calls her old doctor and unloads her fears on him. He calls her doctor and her husband to come get her. While trying to get away from them, she goes into labor and is forced to deliver at home. They tell her that the baby died in birth, but she hears a baby crying through the wall. She’s still pumping milk and it’s being collected. She finds out that the old couple is still in their apartment, along with her husband, and that her baby is there. She looks in at the baby and is horrified by what she sees. The neighbors are part of a cult who called Satan up to get Rosemary pregnant. Guy tries to comfort her and she spits in his face. Rosemary is horrified until she hears the baby cry, and she moves to the crib and smiles at the baby.</p>
  <h3><a id="thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <p>The movie starts with suitably creepy lala-ing over the city pan, and all I could think was “A real movie with an actual budget!” This is the first major movie that I’ve watched for this, and it showed. Good camera work and music, very good acting, especially from <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001201/">Mia Farrow</a> as Rosemary. The movie was well paced, with very little fluff. I deeply enjoyed the arc of the movie as well, with Guy and Rosemary being very much in love at the beginning and the subsequent downward slide of the relationship. My biggest complaint in the movie is Guy. His actor put in work, doing very well by acting distant after the ritual, but he did come across as wooden or forced in some scenes. Rosemary as a character was very wishy washy, believing almost nothing on her own and following whatever is pointed out to her. Her anxiety about the baby, though, is presented as paranoia, which is framed very nicely through the increasingly frantic cuts and music. This is far and away the best acted movie I’ve seen thus far. The ending was amazing, best part of the movie</p>
