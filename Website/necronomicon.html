  <h3><a id="summary">Summary</a></h3>
  <p>A man, H.P. Lovecraft, makes his way into a library as he narrates about the importance of the book he is looking for, the Necronomicon, a book that is of vital importance to the human race as it contains the knowledge of past and future that can be used to save the world. He is let into a chamber by a monk, who warns him not to leave the area. Lovecraft steals his keys and makes his way to a locked chamber. He finds a safe that is unopenable, but as the door slams shut behind him and he drops the keys into water below a grate in the chamber, the safe swings open, revealing the book he had been seeking. He pulls it out and starts to read it, and as he does, a mechanism turns, opening a panel in the safe to a new panel. In the first story, “The Drowned”, Edward is arriving to an inheritance, an old hotel abandoned for 60 years. The realtor tells him that his uncle Jethro, the owner, died by falling out of his balcony window. The hear a noise and the realtor tells him that there are caves below the hotel are hollowed out by the sea. She urges him to sell the house, but he says no, and she leaves. He has a flashback of driving a car off of a cliff and his lover, Clara, drowning in the car while he escaped. He sees a painting of Jethro’s wife, Emma, and finds a letter from Jethro and reads it. Jethro describes his family taking a trip overseas, but their ship is cast into the rocks and he’s the only survivor, his wife and son dead. When he comes to, he throws a bible into a fire and chases all of the mourners out of his house. While weeping over his wife, a figure in black and covered in kelp walks in, dropping a cloth covered package, and reveals itself to be a fish-like humanoid. The thing leaves, and Jethro opens the package to find the Necronomicon, which opens to a ritual that can bring the dead back to life. He performs the ritual, calling out Cthulhu’s name, and a green light appears below the floor. His son and Emma rise from the tables they were laid on and walk towards him, but their eyes turn green and tentacles erupt from the boy’s mouth. He throws himself from the balcony, but the letter describes him hiding the book before he did. Edward looks for the book, but can’t find it. While asleep, a tentacle caresses his face and tells him the book is being protected by Jethro’s love. He pries the painting off the wall and finds the book there and performs the same ritual to bring Clara back. When he goes back to bed, she comes into the hotel and moves up to his room, calling his name and asking for permission to come in. He says yes, and she comes to him, kissing first before tentacles come from her mouth. He pushes her off and sees a long tentacle coming from her back and going down the stairs and into the floor in the cave below. He uses a sword to cut her, and she flies back into the floor, turning back into a tentacle. The floor breaks open and a large tentacle covered monster rises up, causing Edward to climb up the walls and onto a chandelier, which he drops onto the monster’s head, driving it back down. As he climbs onto the roof and sees the sunrise, he hears the monster roaring out from the ocean below. As Lovecraft keeps reading, another panel opens in the safe. In the second story, “The Cold”, a reporter named Dale arrives at a house and confronts the owner about eleven missing bodies in the last forty years and wants to know what happened to a doctor named Madden. The house is freezing, and is kept cold because of a rare skin condition that the owner has that requires cold. She tells him that her mother, Emily, took up residence in the house after arriving in Boston, with only one other letter, Madden. While she is in the shower, a man breaks into her room and attacks her, claiming to be her step brother and demanding that she come home after performing favors for him. She escapes from her room, but he tracks her down and knocks her into the stairs. Madden comes out and attacks him to her him off of her and brings her into his apartment, which is freezing due to, as he explains, a rare skin condition that needs cold temperatures for him to stay alive. She goes back to bed, but awakes to see red liquid dripping from her ceiling. She goes to Madden’s room and see Madden and the landlady, Lena, drilling holes into her brother’s body. She passes out and wakes up in her bed, being told it was a dream. She tries to get a job in a diner and is told that Madden has to be over 100 years old, and she sees a picture that two officers are looking at of a body with holes drilled in its back. She confronts Madden, realizing that what she saw wasn’t a dream and tries to leave the house but her stops her on the stairs. He weakens after a moment and she had to take him back to her room and bury him in ice to make him feel better. When he does, he shows her the Necronomicon, which has a way to stave off death. He gives her a withered rose and injects a liquid into it, bringing it back to vitality, and tells her that it will never wither as long as it stays cold. They have a romantic interlude, after which Lena tries to convince her that she has to help kill people to keep him alive. She leaves, but comes back several months later when she finds out she’s pregnant and finds them trying to kill the diner owner. She frees him, but as Lena is trying to attack Emily, Madden stops her, accidentally setting fire to his apartment. He starts to melt and Lena shoots Emily, but doesn’t kill her when she reveals her pregnancy. Back in the present, Dale posits that Emily is the woman he’s talking to, and she says she is, before drugging him. Lovecraft looks up to see another panel slide open, but keeps reading. In the third story, “The Whispers”, two officers, Sarah and Paul, are chasing a suspect in their car while arguing that hooking up was a mistake. Sarah says she’s pregnant as the suspect turns a corner and stops. Sarah turns the corner, runs into the car, and flips, passing out. When she awakens, she sees Paul being dragged out and crawls out to chase the man into a building. She falls through the floor and passes out. When she comes to, she sees a blood trail into a basement area and stops a man coming up from the basement. He claims to own the building and rents it to the man who took Paul, calling him the Butcher. He leads her to an area where a woman tries to shoot at them with a shotgun who claims to be the man’s wife. They lead her to a tunnel that the Butcher uses to get in and out of the building and the woman tells Sarah that the Butcher’s an alien, though the man tells her that he works for aliens and shows her a relief in the tunnel of a man chopping a man apart and feeding it to a creature. As they get to the end of the tunnel, the man reveals himself to be the Butcher before throwing her into a pit filled with blood and bodies. Something flies at her and she shoots at it, missing and hitting the wall instead, which oozes green. She finds Paul, who rises, shaky, and approaches her, though the back of his head is missing. Something breaks out of his body, lithe and winged, and speaks to her in his voice, telling her how the creatures could take their brains and make them live forever. She screams and passes out, waking to find the man and the woman at her side, her legs and an arm missing. The woman opens her dress, revealing herself to be a creature that had eaten her unborn child. The monk who had let Lovecraft in comes to the chamber and tells Lovecraft to put the book back or suffer the consequences. The last panel in the safe opens, revealing a portal behind it. The monk slides through the bars and tries to attack Lovecraft as a tentacle mouth comes out of the portal. Lovecraft gets the monk in the way and he’s eaten by the tentacle, which is sucked back into the portal and the safe closes, opening the chamber door. Lovecraft leaves, taking the book with him.</p>
  <h3><a id="thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <p>I love the Lovecraft mythos and was really looking forward to this movie, but I was massively disappointed. As with so many horror movies, the effects were the best thing, with little else good. Many practical effects were great, including the monster in the first segment, but they were massively overpowered by so many bad camera shots, including several that slowed the shots down to 5 fps for several seconds before going back to normal for no discernable reason. Some of these stories make no sense as well, especially to someone who knows the mythos. Calling Cthulhu’s name and rhyme from his story would not bring back the dead or summon a tentacle headed monster. How could a man surviving in near frozen places on spinal fluid possibly procreate? And the pacing and shots of the final segment were nonsensical in their editing. I struggled to follow it. The acting is the worst part of this, ranging from great from the far-too-absent <a href=”https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001062/”>Jeffrey Combs</a> to the abysmal performance from Emily, who jerked around for no reason. I have a few more <a href="dagon.html">Lovecraft</a> <a href="cthulhu.html">movies</a> on my list, and I hope that they’re better than this one.</p>
