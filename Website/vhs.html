  <h3><a id="summary">Summary</a></h3>
  <p>Four men in masks film themselves harassing women, destroying a building with bats, and vandalizing someone’s house. They watch the recordings and discuss how they’re being paid for filming what they’re doing. They head to a house, talking about how they’re being paid to steal a single VHS tape. They break into the home, discussing the old man who lives in this house, and what to do if he wakes up. They find a room with the old man dead in front of a bank of TVs, the only furniture in the house. The camera man puts the camera down and watches one of the tapes in the VCRs. The first segment starts with some guys exclaiming over a hidden camera in a pair of glasses. They go to a club and try to pick up girls and find a group of girls they party with. One of the girls, a pale girl with wide eyes, takes a liking to the guys with the glasses and tries to be closer to him. When they leave, they head back to the hotel room with two of the girls, including the pale one. The other girl and one of the guys start to get heavy, but the girl passes out, so the guy tries to make a move on the pale girl. He takes off her dress and they see that her feet are scaly and clawed. She tries to go after both guys and the glasses guy leaves. The third guy, trying to get in on the action, tries to make a move, but she bites him. When they try to confront her, she grows fangs, wings, and her forehead open, and slashes the first guy’s throat open. The other two hide in the bathroom while she mauls the body. The third guy takes the shower curtain rod and tries to attack the girl but she grabs it and attacks him, killing him and drinking his blood. When she starts to cough, glasses guy tries to flee but falls down the stairs, breaking his wrist. The girl follows, crouching over him, and tries to pleasure him, but when he doesn’t respond, she freaks out. He tries escape, appealing to people in the parking lot for help, until he’s lifted off of the ground, carried off by the girl, and the glasses fall to the ground below. Back in the house, the main camera man has disappeared from in front of the TV. Another guy picks up the camera and some of the guys find a trove of VHSs and search for the one they’re looking for. One of them sees a man move into a hidden part of the room, but the other guy, Gary, doesn’t believe him and they start bagging the VHSs to search through later. The new camera man puts in one of the VHSs they found to check it out. In the video, a couple is fueling their car for a road trip. At one point, they see a car wrecked off the side of the road. They enter a town and the woman, Stephanie, finds a horse to pet. When they get to the hotel room, she investigates the room to see how dirty it is. They find a wild west themed area and put a dollar into the machine. Stephanie gets her fortune, which talks about a reunion with a loved one and to beware of people advantage of her good nature. When they get back to the hotel room, the man, Sam, tries to convince Stephanie to film herself getting undressed, but she says no. He keeps trying to convince her but she says no until someone knocks at the door. Sam tells Stephanie that a college aged girl asked for a ride the next day. They tell her no and discuss the state of the area they’re in and go to bed. While they’re sleeping, someone turns on the camera and films them, pulling Stephanie’s covers down and taking out a knife. They then steal the money from Sam’s wallet and put Sam’s toothbrush in the toilet. In the morning after they leave, Sam finds the money missing and accuses Stephanie of stealing the money, though she protests, asking where she would have gone. They get to a vista of bluffs and mesas and Sam goes to see how far down he can climb. They get back to the hotel room and plan out the next day before going to sleep. The person with the knife comes in and stabs Sam in the throat. While she’s cleaning off her hand. She takes off her mask and starts to kiss Stephanie. They drive off and Stephanie asks if she erased the tape. Back in the house, the old man in the chair is gone. No one notices and they put in the next tape. A group of two women and two men are on a trip to a lake. They stop the car at the a dead end and walk through the woods. One of the women, Wendy, asks the cameraman, Joey, to focus on a wall that her friend tripped over last time she was there and the camera cuts to a dead woman, throat cut, on the wall before cutting back. They get to the lake and the camera cuts again to a man face down with his spine exposed. As they walk on, Wendy tells Joey that they’re all going die out here before they walk on. They sit on the edge of the lake and Joey asks Wendy why she said that and she tells them that there were murders at this lake. The other two go off into the woods with the camera and while the woman is performing a dance, a glitch appears on the side of the screen in the shape of a man and throws a knife through the woman’s head. The glitch attacks the man and stabs him, making him drop the camera. Wendy picks it up, smiles, and takes it to see Joey, telling him that he’s bait to lure out the killer of her friends. A staticy glitch appears behind him and slits his throat. Wendy tries to use the camera to see the man and attack him, but he stabs her hand. She flees through the forest and warns anyone seeing the tape not to come to the wood. Joey walks through the woods towards her, his throat cut, and falls over. The glitch appears behind him and tries to attack Wendy, but he steps on a trap that causes a pallet with spikes to hit him in the face. Wendy taunts him, but another glitch comes out of a tree and slits her abdomen open. Back at the house, the old man is back, but the new cameraman is gone. Another one of the men puts in a new tape to watch while Gary goes to looks for the others. A couple is skyping each other, talking about an upcoming visit to see each other. She tells him that she heard footsteps in her apartment and that she was too scared to check them out. She calls him later after hearing something at her bedroom door. She tries to show him what’s going on and there’s nothing there. When she goes back into her room, a small white shape appears in the doorway, runs in, and slams the door. The next morning, they skype again to talk about what happened the woman starts messing with her arm, complaining of a lump. He tells her not to mess with it. That night, she skypes him again about the same noises and goes to investigate. She can’t turn the lights on in her living room and they see a shape that hisses at her and chases her back into the bedroom. The next day, she calls again and starts messing with her arm again, digging under the skin to find the bump. He gets her to stop and clean the wound. That night, she calls again and gets him to help her talk to the thing that keeps showing up in her apartment, but she’s going to close her eyes so she needs him to narrate for her. He sees two figures in her living room. The camera flashes and she on the ground, the figures at her side. He comes in and cuts something fetus-like out of her back, yelling at the children in the background at how many times they’re going to do this to her, that the lump in her arm is a tracking device, and how he has to make it look like an accident. They reply in a strange language. She comes back on the next morning, her arm broken, telling him she has a schizophrenic disorder. He tells her not to worry about anything and that everything will be ok. Another girl calls him on skype, complaining about a lump in her arm, and he says he’ll look at it when he gets there. Back in the house, the old man and other person are both gone. Gary finds the camera and goes to look for the others, hearing noises in the house. He finds one of the guys decapitated and sees the old man in the doorway. He runs and falls down the stairs as the old man moves towards him, his mouth wide and bloody. The camera cuts back to the empty room and another tape starts to play. A group of four college men go to a party on Halloween and show up to the house with no one there. They enter the house to investigate and the lights begin to flicker. A pale woman appears in the background before disappearing. Doors begin to open on their own as they search through rooms in the house. In a bedroom, a girl is in a chair in the mirror, but not when the camera turns to it, and the lights go out. He gets out and finds the others. They hear voices in the attic and find a group of men performing a chant with a woman tied up. The woman screams for help as the men try and get the group to leave, but they intervene when one of the men starts to assault the woman. Something starts to pull the men up into the ceiling and the groups tries to flee before remembering the woman. They untie her and take her with them, arms rising from the floor to take the last of the attackers. As they flee, objects begin to fly around, doors start to warp, and arms reach out of the wall. They flee into the basement and escape outside through a storm cellar. They get into their car with the woman and drive off. They try to find a hospital for the woman, but the car starts to slow down and stop. The lights flicker and the woman disappears, reappearing outside and screaming at them. She appears in front of the car and walks off and the group realize they’re on train tracks with a train coming. They try to escape, but can’t get out of the car in time.</p>
  <h3><a id="thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <p>A decent anthology movie, but nothing amazing or groundbreaking. All of the segments focused on mostly college aged people, which I get was the demographic they were aiming for, but they went too hard on the partying douche bros aesthetic of the college aged people. Most of the men in the movie were sleazy, trying to force themselves on people or drink themselves stupid. The last group was an actually decent group of people. Trying to step in to help who they perceived as a victim, but they got punished for it. Mostly the people who were bad got what they deserved, which I do enjoy seeing. My favorite segment was the first one, because the creature effects were so good. I know that the segment spun off into a <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4667854/">standalone film</a> about the girl monster, so I may need to give that a watch. The effects overall were good, the best being the first and last segments. The hands coming out of the walls and floors was really well done. The third segment’s effects were lacking, clearly bought at a costume shop, though the glitch effect was pretty good. The fourth segment confused me. Why did the aliens have to look like children? Couldn’t they have found costumes for them to wear, or make them appear otherworldly other than “small creepy children”? Camera work was found footage, so varied, but pretty good. I like the concept of a skype call found footage, which was interesting. Acting was decent, but I don’t think it was too hard for the people to act like college douche bros or various amounts of screaming. The best actor by far was the monster girl from the first segment, creepy, shy, but a voracious monster in the end. </p>
