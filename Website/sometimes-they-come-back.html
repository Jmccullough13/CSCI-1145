  <h3><a id="summary">Summary</a></h3>
  <p>Jim monologues about memories while he’s moving back to the town he grew up in because it was the only teaching job he could get, though it was the same town where his brother had died. He and his wife, Sally, and son, Scott, move into a somewhat run down house. On his first day of teaching, one of his students, Chip, tell him that the class is full of seniors that mostly have lower grades. Chip tells him that he should pass them because they’re on the football team. He tells them no, and they go to the principal, who takes him aside for a chat in his office to make sure that he doesn’t repeat why he got fired in Chicago. He goes to see his old house and has a flashback of his brother and a train. The flashback continues in a dream where four older boys get out of a car to accost Jim and his older brother, Wayne. He wakes to hear sobbing, but when he checks on his son but sees him sleeping. Suddenly, he’s in his childhood home and sees himself sobbing on the front step until Wayne comes out to cheer him up. They run up to some tracks, but Jimmy stops, afraid of a tunnel on the tracks. They start to go through, but four boys pull up in a black car and accost them, demanding money from the kids for passage. Wayne refuses and is assaulted, his shoes stolen. Jimmy tries to stand up to them and Wayne punches the leader. He pulls out a knife and threatens Wayne, but another boy pushes Wayne onto the knife. They try to get Jimmy to silence him, but a train comes and runs into them and their car, causing it to explode. Later, Chip confronts Jim in the parking lot about getting Fs in class and Chip threatens him. He drives off, and another student, Billy, approaches him and talks to him about some anxiety. They talk a bit and Billy rides off on his bike, seeming to be sheered up. He drops his wallet, and Jim drives after him. A black car like the one from Jim’s past pulls out after him, driving close behind him. Jim sees it and speeds up. Billy calls out to other people, but no one else sees the car. Billy hits the side of a bridge and launches, dying as he hits the rocks below. The next day, he has a new student who’s very cozy with Chip. He turns around, and it’s the lead bully from his past, who tries to torment him. Another student in the class, Kate, helps him calm down. Someone throws something at the board behind his back and he yells at them, causing the principal to tell him to take a break. At a parade, Scott sees a pair of shoes, just like Wayne’s, hanging from a lamppost. They fall, and he brings them to Jim, who looks up to see the lead Bully, Lawson, staring at him. That night, as they watch a movie, he sees a flashback of him and Wayne. Wayne turns to look at him from the TV and yells at him to run, and Jim hears a train whistle. He goes to the tunnel and finds the tracks dismantled. Upset, he walks through town and runs into Kate. Kate is ambushed by Lawson and another of the boys, who pulls a knife on her. Jim shoots up in his bed, having dreamt Kate’s attack, and snaps at his family when they check on him. The next day, while the students are taking a test, Lawson laughs and looks at Kate’s empty seat. Jim calls for a search of the area that he saw in his dream for Kate and finds her body hanging in a barn. The other teachers think that their deaths are a string of suicides, though Jim insists she was murdered. A new kid, Vincent, arrives in his class, another one of the bullies from the past. The student pulls out a knife in class and tries to pull the blade on Jim when he takes it from him. Chip arrives at his house that evening and tries to give him a warning about Lawson and Vincent, that they want revenge on Jim, and that he’s leaving town because he can’t fight them. As he’s leaving, Lawson hits him from behind in his car, driving with him on his windshield before pulling him into the car. They introduce him to North, another of the bullies. They show him their true forms, decayed corpses, and cut him apart, throwing his parts off of a bridge. The police chief comes to Jim’s house and takes him to the station to talk about Billy and Kate’s deaths and his knowledge of them. They let him go, but the chief finds him at school the next day to tell him that Chip disappeared. He hears the boys laughing in the bathroom and goes in to talk to them, and can’t see their reflections in the mirror. He throws Lawson into the lockers outside of the bathroom, but stops when he realizes he can be seen. As Scott is walking home, the black car chases his down, ramming into another car to try and get him. Jim tries to talk to Sally, but she doesn’t seem to believe him. Jim goes to the station to try and find an officer who found him after Wayne died. He finds him in a retirement home, and the officer tells him that he was shot in the head and nearly died, and when he was out, he saw Wayne, who told him that Jim needed to settle with them. He finds the bullies’ graves and they appear, telling him they need the fourth kid to settle things. He finds the fourth, Mueller, who survived the attack, and forces him to come with him to the tunnel. The others don’t show up, and Mueller runs off. The bullies show up at Jim’s house and Sally sees them and she locks the doors and windows, but they break in through the windows and surround Sally and Scott. Jim arrives and shoots Lawson, though it doesn’t hurt him. They leave, telling Jim they wanted to make sure that he does what they want him to. He takes Sally and Scott to a church to hide and has a flashback of him as a kid taking the keys to the car, preventing them from turning the car on to escape from the train. He goes to his childhood home, which had been abandoned for years, and retrieves the key from where he hid it. Mueller comes in and tells Jim that he believes him and is ready to go with him to finish things. They leave the house and Jim’s car explodes, caused by the bullies. They take Mueller with them and head to the tunnel, but first they go to the church to try and get Sally and Scott. However, when Lawson tries to go into the church, his leg catches fire. They taunt Sally from outside as Jim goes to Wayne’s grave to ask for help. A portal opens behind the grave and a figure emerges from some smoke, but the portal closes. Scott is tricked outside by Lawson pretending to sound like Jim, and they get Sally and Scott. Jim goes into the tunnel and the car pulls in behind him. Lawson, North, and Vincent get out and taunt him. Mueller tries to stop them but is stabbed by Lawson, and as he dies, Wayne comes through. They play out the events of before, but Jim shows them the key and throws it where they can’t get it. A train, cloaked in red smoke, comes through the tunnel, and Jim gets his family out before the bullies are hit by the train. Jim talks to Wayne, telling him it’s been 27 years. Wayne begs Jim to stay, and Jim tells him he can’t stay. Wayne asks him to go with him, but Sally and Jim talk him out of it. They embrace, and Wayne leaves to go back. Jim and his family walk out of the tunnel to go home.</p>
  <h3><a id="thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <p>Another Stephen King one! I had planned on watching another movie for this year, but I couldn’t get past 15 minutes of the pretentious and experimental (read here: awful) camera shots, so I changed my mind. This was a TV movie, but a better story than the movie I had been planning on. The music was well balanced in this movie, playing only when needed, except during the climax, where it made up for lost time. The silence helps set the tension better than plenty of music. The makeup on Jim to make him look haggard and tired was pretty good. The movie was pretty good at building up suspense throughout most of it, using Jim’s growing fear of the dead coming back, but it fell apart at the end, where the events became very generic, very cliched, and very cheesey. The bullies were howling goons that laughed like monkeys for most of the time they were on the screen. When the spoke and threatened, they were menacing, but it went out the window the second they started laughing. The other actors were pretty solid, especially Jim, who did a great job.</p>
