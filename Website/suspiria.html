 <h4>1982</h4>
  <h3><a id="summary">Summary</a></h3>
  <p>Suzy decides to complete her ballet training in Germany and arrives in a storming downpour. She arrives at the ballet school as a woman, Pat, runs out and the people in the school refuse to let her in. As she’s driving away from the school, she sees Pat running through the woods. Pat arrives at a friend’s apartment and sees something outside that frightens her before someone breaks the glass and stabs her repeatedly with a knife. Her friend tries in vain to find help but is ignored. As Pat’s heart is being stabbed, she’s dropped through a rooftop window and hanged, her friend dying as shards of glass hit her in the head. The next morning, Susie arrives at the school and is welcomed warmly. Susie meets her fellow dancers, including Olga, her roommate and queen bee. Susie encounters a woman cleaning some silver in a hallway and something sparkles in the air, causing her to become weak and dizzy. She passes out while she’s dancing. When she awakens, she finds out she’s been hemorrhaging and is told to take it easy and follow a special diet that they provide. Olga throws her out and she’s forced to move in with Sarah, another dancer in her group. Maggots from a spoiled food shipment pour from the ceiling of the rooms and everyone’s forced to sleep in dance room. Sarah awakens, hears something, and wakes up Suzy, insisting that the directress is there because they can hear her snoring, though she’s supposed to be out of town. The guide dog for the pianist of the school bites the nephew of the vice headmistress and the pianist is fired. Sarah hears the teachers leaving and starts to take notes on what she hears, convinced they’re up to something. The pianist leaves a bar and his dog starts barking at nothing. They hear someone chanting and something flies over their heads. Out of nowhere, the dog leaps up and lunges for the pianist’s throat, tearing it out and eating him. Sarah tells Suzy that Pat left because she found something out and left notes behind, but when they go to get the notes, they’re gone. Suzy passes out again and Sarah hears sees something in the mirror before fleeing the room and into the attic. Someone attacks her with a razor and as she tries to escape, she jumps into a room filled with razor wire and the person with the razor cuts her throat open. Suzy is told the next morning that Sarah has left and when Suzy calls to talk to Sarah’s friend, a psychiatrist, and goes to talk to him at a convention. He tells her that the founder of the school was a Greek woman who was believed to be a witch. He introduces her to an “expert” on witches, who tells her what that witches use their power to hurt others to gain wealth and riches. When Suzy returns to the school, everyone is gone and the lights start to flicker. She gets rid of the food they’ve been giving her to treat her condition. She sees something outside of her window and a bat flies in and attacks her. She manages to kill it and hears the teachers walking away from the front door again and follows them into the assistant directress’ room. She finds a secret passage and follows it to see the assistant directress calling for Suzy’s death. Suzy runs away, scared, and stumbles across Sarah’s body, which is nailed to a board. She flees into another room and finds the directress, who rises and accuses Suzy of wanting to kill her. She possesses Sarah’s body and attacks Suzy, but Suzy manages to stab the directress, causing the entire building to start to collapse and the teachers to die in the firey remains.</p>
  <h3><a id="thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <p>Why narration over credits in the beginning? There was some unsettling imagery, like the footsteps crunching on maggots and closeups of maggots, and it did help ratchet up the tension. Harsh noises, unsettling red lighting, and the music set a scarier mood than the plot did. However, there were times when the music cut in when something scary was about to happen and chanting joined in, but I could never tell if the character was hearing the chanting or if it was just the music. Sometimes it seemed like they heard something, sometimes not, and it felt inconsistent. Was it meant to signify that something was causing the attacks or just setting the mood for the scary scenes? Why was the directress being there scary other than raspy breathing? They never said…There was random yelling for almost no reason, seemingly to try and heighten tension, but it made it seem more ridiculous. Sarah was a terrible actress, chewing the scenery with her scared acting, and no other actor was much better. Suzy looked constipated when she was supposed to look scared. I hate when movies make part of the plot “I know all about witches” as if there was some common knowledge about the facts of witches and not just myths, rumors, and stories. Rosemary’s Baby did it too and it drove me nuts. The head witch wasn’t scary in the slightest. She sounded like Daffy Duck going nuts after doing something wacky... </p>
