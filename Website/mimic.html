 <h4>1997</h4>
  <h3><a id="summary">Summary</a></h3>
  <p>A disease called Strickler’s disease is affecting children, and for two years, it’s been ravaging the streets of New York. A team of scientists takes a container into the sewers and releases genetically engineered bugs that are designed to kill off cockroaches, the carriers of the disease. Six months later, and no new case has been diagnosed. Susan Tyler, the creator of the bug, a combination of mantis and termite, explains the bug to the press and how it works. Three years later, a pastor is being chased onto the roof of a building. He locks the door, but whatever is pursuing him tears at the door. He runs to the edge and drops to a painters scaffolding below before falling to the ground. In a nearby apartment, a young boy, Chuy, notices him and comments on his shoes. The thing that was pursuing the pastor drops down next to him and starts to click, and the boy picks up some spoons and taps them to the rhythm of the clicking. The things drags the man into the sewers, disappearing below. The next day, the area has been quarantined up. Peter Mann, head of the CDC in New York and Susan’s husband, arrives to the area and meets with Josh, a detective. They find a large group of people in the basement of the building, all of them sick with yellow fever. They walk through the building, comment on the missing preacher, and find a piece of excrement on the ceiling, taking a sample before they leave. At her office, Susan is approached by some kids who bring her a bag of insects for her collection for study. She shows them some termites and gives them a lesson of termite hierarchy and they try to get some money off of her. They show her a bug they found in the subway, which is in a big box, and outside, the thing that stalked the preacher is looking up at her office. Josh gives Peter the analysis of the excrement they found, which had two large wooden buttons in it. Susan takes the bug, which is the size of her hand, out of the box and examines it, but it bites onto her glove. She mounts it on a board and pulls out tapes of the bugs she created, the Judas breed, and compares her notes to the bug, confirming that it’s a Judas breed. The thing makes its way from outside the window silently into the lab and to the bug. It knocks over a lamp, and Susan comes to see what made the noise and finds the bug gone. Chuy sees the thing outside his window but it disappears into the quarantined building. Peter tells Susan to stop working at night, but she tells him that she found a bay of the bugs they released, which was supposed to have died off in six month and never bred. The boys show Peter and Susan where in the subway they found the bug, and they search in an abandoned bathroom and find a recess under a bank of lockers. Peter drops his flashlight into the hole and Susan tries to get it, pulling back before a thing can get to her. Susan meets Chuy in the subway and remarks about his ability to use the spoons. They boys search in the subway for more signs of the bugs to get to Susan and find an egg. They see the thing eating a dog and try to back away, but draw its attention and, revealing itself to be a human sized Judas, get eaten. Susan goes to speak to a colleague about the Judas’ and he tells her it is likely that some survived. Chuy hears the clicking again in the quarantined building and goes into the building to see the thing and runs into two of them. The next morning, Susan gets a call from a colleague, Remy, about a giant bug found in a water filtration plant. Chuy’s father finds him missing the next morning. Josh and Peter go back into the subway bathroom, escorted by an officer, and remove the locker bank to find a large hole in the wall, leading down into the sewers. Chuy’s father finds a toy dropped by Chuy in the entry way into the quarantined building and breaks in to try and find him. Susan sends the bug with Remy to her colleague to be dissected, and he finds that it could have bred and was of the solider caste, meaning there’s a colony. Deeper in the sewer, Peter and Josh find an abandoned living setup and the officer tells them that it used to be inhabited by homeless people before they disappeared. They find a room full of what appears to be excrement. Susan, waiting for Peter in the subway, encounters an adult Judas and is taken into the subway tunnels. Peter and the officer fall off of a platform into a deeper part of the tunnel. They send Josh back up for help. Susan wakes up in the sewer and finds a pipe to use as a weapon. She stabs one and runs, but it gets back up and chases her down deeper into the sewers. Josh gets lost in the sewers and finds a nest of eggs. He tries to escape, up into an abandoned workshop, but is killed by a Judas. Susan is found by Chuy’s father, who finds Peter and the officer. Peter pulls her up to where they are and they’re chased into an abandoned car by a Judas. They trap it in the door and rip it half. They find out that it has lungs and have been evolving rapidly. They’re attacked by a horde of Judas’ and rub parts of the carcass all over the train to make them think that they’re part of the group. They make a plan to get the car moving to get to a part of the tunnel that could lead to the surface. Chuy’s father and Peter go out to try and get the tracks running again and Peter’s cornered by one before it moves on, and he gets the electricity working. Chuy’s father find Chuy, alive, but is attacked and killed by a larger Judas. Susan and the officer talk about killing the only male in the colony to kill off the entire colony and realize that Chuy’s father was killed. Susan goes out and to find what happened to him and finds Chuy. The train starts to move again, but the officer is injured and starts to bleed, drawing the Judas to him in the car. Peter gets to Susan and Chuy and hide while the officer tries to lead the Judas’ away from the train. Peter finds a dumbwaiter and gets Susan and Chuy up and out, but he wants to stay behind and kill the male. The male arrives and sees the wire holding the dumbwaiter up and starts to cut at them, barely giving them time to escape before the elevator falls back down. Peter is chased by some of the Judas into a large nesting area with hundreds of them hanging from the ceiling. He finds a gas pipe and breaks it open, trying to use a lighter to light it up, but drops it into water below him. He uses a pipe to create a spark and dives into the water, causing massive explosions in the sewers that reach up into the streets. Susan and Chuy come out on tracks, followed by the male, who bears down on Chuy, but Susan distracts him by cutting open her hand. A train approached, and Susan runs against the wall, letting the train destroy the male. She and Chuy escape to the surface but are told that they swept the area and nothing could have survived. Chuy goes to the subway entrance and sees Peter come up the stairs. The three of them embrace./p>
  <h3><a id="thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <p>I wasn’t sure what to expect with this one. I love Del Toro and all of his works, but I had never heard of this one. I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. The effects of the insects was mostly CG, but it was only used in wide shots in the dark so the bad 90s CG didn’t stand out too much. All of the close up shots were practical puppets (provided by the Henson company) and looked fantastic. I would have loved to see all of them in practical, but this was late 90s, and the dawn of CG EVERYTHING was oncoming, so I’m not surprised. I’ll take what I can get. The acting was decent. The officer was the best, I think, acting incredibly like a New Yorker, though still with compassion. Susan wasn’t amazing, and her scared and upset acting was stiff, but she, as well as everyone else, was pretty good otherwise. The characters were actually smart and all of them believable. Susan used her knowledge for their benefit in multiple situations to help save them instead of relying on dumb luck. The music was generic orchestrations, but it fit well. I’d happily watch this movie again, even if it’s not my favorite in this list. My biggest complaint was that the movie changed from a subtle sinister kind of horror to a full on creature feature once the insects were fully revealed.</p>
