 <h4>2000</h4>
  <h3><a id="summary">Summary</a></h3>
  <p>Alex is packing his bags for a high school spring break trip to France. His mom tries to take the flight sticker off of the bag, but he stops her, saying that it’s better to keep it on, since the last flight it was on didn’t crash, maybe this one won’t. While asleep, a wind from nowhere blows around his room and wakes him up to see the middle zero in 1:00 turn into an 8, displaying the same number as his flight. At the airport, as they unload off the bus, Carter, a jock, tries to dump an extra bag on Billy, knocking him over, and laughs at him. Alex keeps seeing things that give him a pause before boarding the plane, like dings in the paint around the door and a song in the bathroom about falling in the sky. As they board the plane, his friend Todd tries to get him to not switch seats with Krista so he can sit next to her, but he does, and when he takes his new seat, the tray table falls open, the pin holding it in falling off in his hand. Alex starts to get nervous as the engine starts and the plane begins to taxi. The plane begins to shake violently before levelling off, then shakes harder, the lights flickering. Bags fall out, Billy drops some whoppers on the ground, rolling everywhere. The masks drops from ceiling and some panels fall out, sparks flying and flames erupting. A part of the plane wall rips off, sending rows of people flying out into the sky. Flames erupt from the engine outside and then spread back from the cockpit, engulfing everyone. Alex awakes to Krista asking Alex to switch seats, and Alex, upset, rushes to the seat next to Todd, immediately pulling the tray table pin out. He starts to shout that the plane is about to explode. An attendant tries to get him to calm down and Carter starts yelling at him, then rises from his seat to try and subdue Alex. Everyone standing in the aisle while he was freaking out is removed from the plane, including Krista, Blake, Carter, his girlfriend Terri, and both teachers chaperoning. Mrs. Lewton manages to convince the pilot to allow one of them back on, and she convinces him to get back on. Todd’s brother convinces him to get off to check on Alex, and Clear follows, upset at his reaction. Mrs. Lewton asks Alex why he freaked out and Alex relates his dream. Carter expresses disdain for this, complaining that they got thrown off the plane because of a dream, and as they get into a fight, the plane explodes in the background, shattering the windows in the terminal. Alex and the survivors are brought into a room to wait for their families and everyone stares at Alex as if he caused it. Two federal agents come in and question them, paying special attention to Alex. Their families arrive, Todd’s father giving Alex an accusatory look, though no one arrives for Clear, so Alex’s family drops her off. At a memorial service at school, flowers are laid on a statue for the killed students. Carter and Alex get into an argument while in line, but Terri breaks them up. Billy tries to ask Alex about his own future, but Alex tells him to go away. Alex tries to talk to Mrs. Lewton, but she tells him to leave her alone. Todd joins Alex at the statue, telling Alex that his father won’t let him hang out with Alex. Clear hands Alex her rose, saying thank you for her still being alive. That evening, Todd goes into the bathroom, closing the window as a breeze blows through and shuts the door. The toilet starts to leak, spilling across the floor. Todd starts to shave, but cuts himself. He sees something pass across the mirror, dark and rippling, but sees nothing behind him. He plugs in a radio and the song from the airport starts to play, and he quickly unplugs it. Alex, studying plane schematics and books on aircraft failures, is spooked by an beating against his window. He throws a magazine at it, and it flies through a fan, ripping itself to shreds. A piece of paper with the word Todd lands on Alex’s leg. Todd pulls back the shower curtain, revealing a clothesline, and as he takes clothes off of it, he slips in the water, landing neck first on the wire. It wraps around his neck and he tries to get it off, spilling soap in the tub in the process and preventing himself from standing up. He tries in vain to unwrap the wire, and dies. The water on the floor recedes back under the toilet. Alex goes to Todd’s house, concerned about him, and sees flashing lights. He sees Todd’s body being wheeled out and, after Clear tells him to leave, Todd’s parents confront him about Alex causing Todd to feel enough guilt over his brother’s death to kill himself. Alex goes to Clear’s house to ask why she was there and she tells him that she had felt what he felt on the plane, though she didn’t know why until he freaked out. She was at Todd’s because she felt his unease that night. Alex posits that Todd may not be the first, and Clear takes him to the mortuary to see Todd’s body to find out what happened to him. They find his body and the Mortician, who tells them that Todd was trying to tear at the wire. He tells them that death has a design, and when Alex asks if they can cheat death, he tells them that if they did, it would unleash something that would scare even the grim reaper. As they leave, the Mortician tells him that he’ll soon him soon. They talk about death’s plan and how they could look for signs. Alex sees the reflection of a bus in a nearbv window, but sees no bus in the street next to him. He tells Clear that maybe their time was still up, that they’re living on borrowed time. Carter and Terri pull up nearby and see Alex and Clear and Carter gets out of the car and yells at Alex because of what’s happening to the people who survived and what they’re dealing with. Terri yells at him and tells him to get over it because she is. She steps back off of a curb and is hit by a bus. Alex sees a news report about the cause of the plane crash and notices that the cause started at Todd’s seat and moved on from there to Terri, and then on to Mrs. Lewton. Mrs. Lewton is packing to move when she sees Alex lurking outside her house and calls the agents. He’s checking her tire pressure when they pull up and take him away. As hse moces away from the window, a breeze comes from the closed window. Alex tells the agents that he’s afraid that Mrs. Lewton is next. He tells them about the pattern and that he intends to break it. They mention how he’s near the deaths after they happen, but let him go. Mrs. Lewton puts a kettle on and sees a shimmer of black across the surface. She pours some hot water into a mug and spills it before putting ice cubes and vodka in the same mug, causing cracks in the base, which drips out onto the floor and into her computer when she places it on top. The computer begins to spark and smoke, and as she moves to investigate it, it explodes, sending a shard of glass into her neck. She slips on the water as the fire ignites the trail of vodka, catching her stove on fire. She tries to grasp at a cloth on a knife block and drops the knife block, impaling one of the knives in her chest. Alex hears her scream and comes in to check on her, trying to stop the bleeding when the over explodes and knocks over a chair, pushing the knife into her chest completely. He runs from the house, Billy seeing him run out, as the house explodes from the gas line, and Alex runs off. The agents contact Clear and tell her to call them if they see him. Carter and Billy meet Clear at the monument and they go to see Alex, hiding near the plane wreckage, to find out who’s next. Carter demands to know if he’s next and Alex tells him it doesn’t matter because they’re all on the list. Carter asks why bother and speeds up, refusing to obey traffic signs and drives into oncoming traffic. Alex sees his seat belt broken before it’s not again, then sees a train in the window. Carter stops the car on train tracks with a train oncoming. Billy, Alex, and Clear get out and plead with Carter to get out. He tries to start the car, but it won’t, and he sees the black ripple across his rear view mirror. His seatbelt won’t release and Alex goes to help him out, ripping his seatbelt in the process. The train hits the car and, as Billy tells Carter he’s still next, the train kicks up a piece of metal from the car and it tears through Billy’s head. Alex figures out that if he can see the death and save someone, he can skip them and move to the next person because Billy was after Carter. Clear hides Alex in her father’s cabin, where he covers everything believing he’s next. The wind blows leaves under the door and knocks his trash bag over into a fishing line, which tries to pull a pantry door open. He slams it shut before it can open, but a knife pierced the door, missing his head by inches. He gloats that he can beat death. Clear sees the agents outside her house and decides to tell them where Alex is to keep him safe. Alex sees a news article with Krista’s picture and remembers that they switched seats, meaning Clear’s next, and he sees a lightning bolt when he tries to light a lighter. Lightning strikes a transformer near Clear’s house, causing it to explode and sending a live wire free in her yard. Alex leaves to help Clear and is pursued by the agents and police. Clear tries to get her dog away from the wire, nearly being impaled by an umbrella. It instead pierces a pool, spilling water at her feet. She jumps onto her balcony as the wire hits the water, clearing it, and the black ripples across the water. Clear tries to escape into her house, but the wire hits her electrical box, overloading everything electrical in her house and setting it on fire. Alex, running through the woods, has a tree knocked on top of him, landing him face down into a puddle, but he gets free. Clear tries to leave her house in a car, but the beam from the top of the garage door falls into the windshield, pinning the car in place. Clear breaks free of the beam, knocking over a gas can, and the wire lands on her car. Alex tells her to stay because the tires ground her, but when he uses a shovel to knock it loose, it knocks off a flame canister, setting fire to the car. He grabs the wire to save her, allowing her to escape, and gets blown backwards, no longer breathing. Six months later, Clear, Carter, and Alex arrive in Paris. While celebrating at beating the design by drinking at a café, Alex tells them that since no on intervened, he should still be next. Alex gets the feeling again. A bus narrowly misses him, sending a lamp pole into sign above a store. The sign swings down at Alex, and Carter jumps at him, knocking him out of the way. Alex exclaims how it skipped him, and Carter asks who’s next as the sign swings back behind him.</p>
  <h3><a id="thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <p>Last one on the list that I’ve seen before, but it’s another of my favorites (Also, 2000 was a terrible year for horror movies). I was hoping this would stand out because of how much I remember loving it, and it didn’t let me down. I noticed some dumb things that I hadn’t before, like Carter’s extremely misplaced anger at Alex, especially on the plane, or Alex completely missing a fishing pole for convenience sake, or even him forgetting where he really sat on the most traumatizing day of his life. Also, he was a dumbass for taking the knife out of Lewton with his bare hands. Also also, why did death need to make Todd’s death look like a suicide? Death wanted something special for Alex, I guess, by making his police suspect. Some minor plot holes here and there along with some contrivances, but I can overlook those in the face of the OVERWHELMINGLY AWESOME death scenes. I love this movie because of the contrived, inventive ways that people die in it, and I love the second and third for the same reason. The fourth was meh, and the fifth was stupid and probably killed the series, but this first one is the best by far. There wasn’t a lot of space for acting, since most of the movie was awesome action scenes, but what there was of it was pretty good. The music, especially the haunting, eerie theme, was amazing. Despite being made in the late 90s early 00s, there was no modern music except during the end credits, and every non score song had a plot point. An amazing movie overall and always worth the watch. </p>
