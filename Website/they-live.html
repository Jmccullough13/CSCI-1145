 <h4>1988</h4>
  <h3><a id="summary">Summary</a></h3>
  <p>A man, Nada, walks through a city and goes to the city jobs and family services, where dozens of people are waiting to apply for jobs. He tries to get one, but is told they have nothing for him. He listens to a street preacher talking about the people who are controlling everything and their puppets, but leaves when an officer arrives. The next day he gets a job working on a construction site and is shown a place to stay by Frank, who leads him to a tent city, where he makes himself useful by fixing some of their amenities. He and Frank discuss how people are living, how higher ups are giving themselves raises and cutting those lower down off. While some people are watching TV, a man cuts in with a pirate broadcast, talking about a resistance group and how scientists found a signal being broadcast, that whoever’s behind it is causing people to become selfish and divided, giving no rights to the people. The people watching complain about getting a headache. Nada sees the street preacher mouthing along to the pirate broadcast, faltering when the signal gets staticy. The street preacher is led away by one of the people providing food to the tent city. Nada asks him about where the preacher went, and he becomes evasive, running off when the people watching TV see the pirate broadcast again. Nada follows the man into a nearby church and sees a makeshift chem lab. He hears the man arguing with others, including the man on the broadcast, about how to reach people. The street preacher finds him and offers him the truth, something to let him see, but he flees. Outside, he uses binoculars to watch the people come out of the church, loading boxes into a car, and drive off. That night, a helicopter with a sniper flies over the church and everyone flees. Police cars follow and they raid the church. More officers in riot gear followed by more cars arrive, bringing a bulldozer to level the tent city, sending everyone in it fleeing. Frank watches in horror, but when Nada calls out to him, he runs in the other direction. Nada makes it out and sees a large group of officers assaulting the street preacher and the broadcast man. He tries to run, but is blocked in by more cruisers. He makes it into a nearby building where others are hiding and watches the rest of the raid. Next morning, while others are going through the wreckage of the tent city, he goes into the church and finds a hidden box that was left behind. He takes it and finds sunglasses inside. Distraught, he hides the box in a trashcan, but takes a pair for himself. When he puts them on, sees the hidden message “Obey” on a billboard, hidden behind a computer ad and “Marry and reproduce” behind a travel ad. He sees other signs that are meant to direct people to submit, consume, stay asleep, obey authority, and give up their free will. He sees them in magazines and on street stands. A man walks up and he sees a strange, alien face when he puts on the glasses. He moves through the city and sees more people with the alien faces, interacting with normal looking people. On TV, he sees a politician with an alien face. He confronts a lady with an alien face and she speaks into her bracelet that he can see them, and every other person in the store with the face also speaks into their bracelet. He’s assaulted by some alien officers who try to take him away and he knocks them out, takes their guns, and shoots them. He takes their guns from their car and wanders into a bank to hide. Armed with a shotgun, he says the iconic line “I am here to chew bubble gum and kick ass, and I am all out of bubble gum. He shoots a couple of the aliens, but one teleports away before he can get him. He escapes and is found by a small saucer with a camera, which he blows out of the sky. He disarms a human officer and lets him go. Inside a parking garage, he forces a human woman, Holly, to take him to her place so he can hide. Her neighbor sees them go inside her house. He tries to tell her about the aliens, but when he tries to get her to see through the glasses, she refuses, telling him she’ll pretend to see what he sees to keep him from hurting her. She hits him in the back of the head and knocks him out of her window, leaving the glasses behind. She calls the police on him, but he escapes, and, left with nothing, makes his way back to the construction site to find Frank, who tells him to leave. He goes to find the glasses that he hid and finds them in a garbage truck. Frank finds him and gives him the money he earned on the construction job and they get into a fight when Nada tries to get him to put on the glasses. He succeeds and Frank can see what he sees, giving him an ally. They go to a hotel to lay low and recover from the fight and figure out their next move. The guy from the church finds them and invites them to a meeting with people who know about the aliens. The people take their glasses and give them contacts that work the same way. They find out that the aliens are here to develop the humans into slaves. The leader of the group tells everyone else that they need to lay low and bide their time, but others want to take the fight to the aliens. Holly arrives and apologizes to Nada, but they’re interrupted by a swat team blowing out the wall and raiding the meeting. Frank and Nada get away and are cornered, but Frank, messing with one of their wrist communicators, manages to teleport them into one of their bases. They make their way around unnoticed and find a meeting of powerful humans and the alien elites, congratulating the humans on their efforts and their wallets. One of the men from the tent city finds them and, thinking they’ve sold out too, shows them around the base, including where they transport to their home and the source of the signal. He takes them to a news station where they turn on him and break into the newsroom, killing any alien they see. They make their way to the roof, finding Holly along the way, and as they make their way to the roof, Holly kills Frank and turns the gun on Nada. He pulls a gun from his sleeve, shoots Holly, and destroys the signal device. He’s shot and dies on the roof, but destroying the signal turns off the alien’s disguises, and everyone can see them for what they are.</p>
  <h3><a id="thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <p>I…I get this movie, but I also don’t get it. I get the message, the allegory for the aliens being the one percent and how they use business and people below them to keep everyone else in their run-down place, but the execution of this movie…It was beyond stupid. So much time was wasted on some scenes, such as Nada after he was thrown out of Holly’s window. The earlier ones with Nada walking through the city were good at establishing the setting we were finding ourselves in, the beaten down common person’s city, but Nada and Frank running through the corridors of the alien base was wasted time. And the fight between Frank and Nada was beyond wasteful! I understand that Roddy Piper (Nada) was a wrestler, but did it need to turn into a full match on screen?! Even when it seemed like it was going to stop, it started again! Holly was obvious from the beginning, but the guy from the tent city being on their pay roll was a neat twist. The best part was during the fight when he broke a car’s rear windshield. Both Keith and Roddy looked surprised and had nervous smiles, like it wasn’t meant to happen. I expected better after the Thing, John… </p>
