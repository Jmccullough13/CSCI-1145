 <h4>2021</h4>
  <h3><a id="summary">Summary</a></h3>
  <p>Text states that a malevolent spirit has been awakened to prey on the weak, depraved, and lost because the Earth has been pillaged and stripped of its life blood. A child, Aiden, plays in an abandoned railway station next to a derelict mining facility. He goes back to his father’s truck as the father, Frank, comes out of one of the buildings, holding a box of objects from within the factory. He tells the kid not to leave the truck and goes back into a mine, putting a gas mask on. He hears a growl but ignores it and continues down to another man packing up equipment from a drug lab. They hear the growling again and go to investigate. A creature with large antlers attacks them and attacks Frank, and the other man runs off. Three weeks later, Julia is teaching a class about storytelling. Lucas, the kid from the beginning’s older brother, is in the class. He heads to a lake and kills a skunk, taking it home with him, where he listens in at a door with freshly installed locks on the outside before heading into the room. Julia hears a report on the radio about the reopening of the mine and has a flashback of hiding under some stairs while a man walks down them. Her brother Paul, the town sheriff, asks her if she’s ok and how teaching is going. In class the next day, Lucas reads the class a story about three bears, a big bear and two little bears, and the big bear and littlest bear become aggressive and mean after going into a cave. After school, he gets into a fight with some other boys and is taken to the nurse’s office. Julia tries to call his home but no one responds, though someone is pounding on the locked door. Julia sees Lucas walking home and buys him some ice cream to get him to talk to her about himself. He tells her about Aiden and that he’s always with his dad, but leaves after she asks what his dad does. He walks back to the mine and finds a dead racoon to take home while Julia drives to his house. She knocks on the door and it opens, but when she steps inside she hears a noise and leaves. At home, she pieces a drawing she found in the trash together to see a person in the mouth of a large creature. Paul comes in and she tells him she’s sorry she left because she had to get through her own issues. Lucas cuts up the racoon and takes it into the locked room, where Frank attacks the meat on all fours. Aiden comes to get some fries Lucas has scrounged up and Lucas promises to come back and see him when Frank has fallen asleep. Julia has a vision of her father choking her from behind while playing the piano and a memory of her father in a fetal position on her bed. She tells Paul about her visit and he tells her about Frank, how he's revived Frank from opioid overdose multiple times but won’t arrest him because of the boys. Lucas hears Aiden behind the door and puts on headphones to not have to hear him anymore. Lucas sets traps in the woods to try and get food. Julia finds bizarre drawings in his desk and takes it to the principal to get her to find help for Lucas, but she only offers to try and reach out to Frank. Paul tells her that someone found a half chewed man in the forest and he has to go investigate. Lucas brings some Cheetos to Aiden but Aiden starts to throw them and blood up. Frank rises from the ground, something inside of him glowing through his chest and back, and Lucas flees. Paul takes the body of the other man from the mine lab to the coroner, who tells him that the teeth marks seem human. The next day, the principal visits Lucas’ house to try and talk to Frank and lets herself into the kitchen while Lucas, at school, carves a monster’s head out of wood. She hears Aiden sobbing behind the locked door and opens it, seeing blood on the walls and gagging on a stench. She finds Aiden curled up in the middle of the room, a trap, and Frank attacks her, chewing on pieces of her. Lucas pushes the monster’s fangs into his arm while at home, Frank starts to transform, his teeth sharpening, and antlers emerging from his mouth. Paul, his deputy, and the former sheriff go into the mines to find the rest of the body and find bags hanging from the ceiling, which the former sheriff identifies as medicine bags of warding, and they find a chunk of antler, which none of them can identify. They get called out of the mine by his office. Lucas is ambushed walking home, but the bully is attacked by a large horned and hairy creature. Lucas runs off and gets home to find the door open, blood on the ground leading to a broken window and the principal’s car in the driveway. He covers the car and cleans the blood off the floor. Paul asks when Julia last talked to the principal because her husband reported her missing and Julia told him she asked the principal to check on Lucas at home. Paul goes to Lucas’ house to talk to Frank but sees nothing inside, Lucas hiding from him. The next day, Paul is called to the school to check on the bully to see is he had been in school because his parents reported him missing. Julia thinks there’s a connection between the disappearances and goes to Lucas’ house to find the principal’s car. Paul finds the principal’s body inside as well as a burnt husk of a body which they think is Frank. Julia waits outside and intercepts Lucas on his way home to keep him from going inside. They take him to the hospital where the doctor tells Paul and Julia that he’s been abused and is severely malnourished. Julia wants to take him in and Paul refuses and they argue about the abuse they suffered from their father. Lucas has a flashback to when his father returned from the mine, locking himself behind the door to keep his kids safe, and pulling Aiden in too when he got “sick” to keep Lucas safe. Julia and Paul go to see the former sheriff, who’s a Native American, to show him a drawing of horned monster’s and a medicine bag they found at Lucas’ house. He asks if Lucas is native and gets concerned when they tell him Lucas isn’t, showing them the antler and a picture of a Wendigo in a book and telling them about the spirit, that they’re eternally hungry and will always attack and eat whoever they come across, and that when they weaken, they find a new host. When they leave, he’s called by the deputy, who’s found the bully’s body eaten. Julia convinces him to take Lucas home and while he’s in a meeting with the mayor about the murders, the deputy checks around the house for dangers. Julia tells Lucas about her father and how he died and that Lucas’ father is dead, but Lucas tells her that his old dad is dead and that his new dad is with Aiden in the mines and that he’ll come for him to take him to the mines. He shows her a picture of wendigos coming out of a man and a small child. They hear screeching outside and Lucas tells them that’s his dad is there. The deputy calls Paul and tells him that something’s in the shed and Paul calls Julia to make sure that she and Lucas are safe. The deputy finds Aiden in a box in the shed and is gored from behind by a wendigo’s horns. Paul arrives and finds the deputy’s body and is knocked aside by the wendigo. Aiden leaves, and the wendigo breaks through the wall, impaling Paul’s arm. Paul tries to fight it off with a hoe but is knocked out. Julia tells him that Lucas left to go to the mines to get Aiden and that she’s going after him, but Paul insists on going to. When they get to the mine, she calls for an ambulance for Paul and goes inside to find Lucas. She comes across the medicine bags and finds a large chamber with Aiden and Lucas and the wendigo eating a bear. She shines a light on the wendigo to reveal a tall, ten foot tall creature wit spindly limbs, several racks of antlers on its head, and Frank’s face on its snout. She shoots it and it attacks her, knocking her to the ground. She impales with a pole and Lucas stabs it in the back, knocking it out. Julia cuts its heart out, killing it, and as soon as it dies, Aiden starts to scream and glow from within. She takes the knife and tried to go to Aiden but Lucas stops her, telling her he’ll get better. She tells him he won’t and he knows it and he step aside, allowing her to hug Aiden to her while she stabs him from behind. Julia and Paul are standing on a beach, watching Lucas playing at the edge of the water, and Paul asks what they’re going to do with him. Julia tells him that they’re going to keep him and takes him back to the car. Paul starts to cough up some blood and blood runs down from his eyes as he turns to look after Julia and Lucas, confused.</p>
  <h3><a id="thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <p>This movie was very, very heavy, dealing with a lot of physical violence issues and the mental issues that come with them. Julia was abused, Lucas was abused and had to deal with watching his father and brother essentially die. Lucas also had to come to terms with his brother becoming a monster and had to stand by as he was killed to prevent that. The horror aspects were overshadowed by the heavy aspects, so I was left feeling the impacts of those rather than the monster itself. The monster was good, designed by Del Toro himself, but we barely got to see it so focused was the movie on the trauma of the main characters. It had a few brief flashes while attacking and the full fight in the mine at the end, but that was only for a few minutes. We need longer to appreciate Del Toro’s design. The pacing was great throughout the movie, with no scene being too extra or adding anything or didn’t need, but the ending felt somewhat rushed, as the movie was chugging along and then suddenly ended. The performances were fantastic, but I’m never disappointed by <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005392/">Kerri Russel</a> in any movie I’ve seen her in. The kid who played <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm8864596/">Lucas</a> was especially good, believable in his portrayal of a kid dealing with the trauma of caring for a rapidly transforming father and younger brother. The camera work was great, the music on point. This movie didn’t do as well as I think it should have, but I can see why some people wouldn’t have enjoyed it. I did, and recommend it heartily.</p>
