 <h4>1995</h4>
  <h3><a id="summary">Summary</a></h3>
  <p>A large shadow passes over a house on a cliff. Inside the house, Alan wakes up, hearing something that sounds like whispers. A couple, Frank and Jill, drive towards a festival that Jill is running, meeting several neighbors, including Callie, whose husband, Ben, is coming home from Japan and a preacher, George, and his wife. At 10 AM, everyone in the festival and the surrounding town of Midwich falls asleep. Frank, who left town to get helium for the festival, returns to town and passes out, crashing his car into another and exploding. A pilot sees the smoke and signals for police. Two arrive, but pass out once they reach a certain point. More police come along with a federal agent Verner and they set up a blockade, keeping people from getting in. Alan arrives from out of town as they send an officer with a gas mask past the border who passes out. The other officers drag him back out and he wakes up. Soon after, the original officers across the border wake up, as does everyone at the festival. Six hours have passed and everyone is trying to figure out what happened, with men in hazmat suits examining the town. Many people complain of being cold. Some time later, women start to become pregnant, including Melanie, a young woman, who George finds crying in the church. At a welcome home party for Ben, Jill sees Ben and Callie looking incredibly upset, and when someone mentions being a father, Ben storms off. Barbara, Alan’s wife, tells him that she’s pregnant, but he seems more upset than happy. He tells Jill that she’s pregnant as well and that there are many pregnancies in Midwich and that all of the pregnancies date from the day that everyone passed out. At a town meeting, when people are freaking out, Alan calms them all down and introduces Verner to the town, who tells them that the government is going to pay all expenses for the women, including an allowance, and will bring in a medical team to assist those who don’t want to keep it. Jill sees Callie outside, who tells her that Ben’s moving out and that she doesn’t want to keep it. Jill and Barbara have strange dreams. Verner talks to her medical team and tells them that every woman is planning on keeping the baby. Every woman gives birth at the same time, all of them in a government location. Melanie has issues, taken to the ICU, and Verner claims it’s stillborn, but takes the baby out to a government vehicle, telling George she is going to autopsy the baby when he asks where she took the baby. Verner shares her results from the autopsy and other exmanations of the children with Alan, noting how they all share common DNA markers. Jill sees her son, still very small, spell his name with blocks. Barbara and Alan;s daughter, Mara, throws a bowl of soup on the floor and her eyes glow green as she stares at Barbara, and Barbara shoves her hand into a boiling pot. When they take her to a doctor, Barbara refuses to tell Alan why she did it, scared of Mara. Barbara jumps off the cliff near their house. Verner tells a panel of government people that there have been accidents, suicides, involved with people coming into contact with the children, and Mara is their leader. They decide to continue to study the children, with focus on the developing powers being paramount. Time passes, and the town falls to shambles, everyone leaving who doesn’t have the children. Seven of the children arrive at Verner’s lab and tell her they can see her thoughts. While one of the children is having her eyes examined, the doctor sees her irises fluctuate and pulse after getting eyes drops. She accidentally gets the wrong drops in her eyes, causing her pain, and Mara forces her to use the drops on herself, causing permanent blindness. George and Verner talk about the accident, and both know it was the children who did it.  Jill tells Alan that the children can’t be in school with the regular kids and begs Alan to teach them, at least some humanity. Jill tries to teach David about empathy, and the next day, when the children are walking, David moves away from them and into the cemetery to find Melanie, who’s thinking about killing herself. While the children are investigating an abandoned barn, George is holding Melanie’s funeral and talking about how the children do not have souls. Alan finds David in the cemetery and David tells him he’s looking for the baby who died. He tells Alan that he doesn’t remember her, but that she was meant to be his partner in the group of children. While looking at Barbara’s grave, David takes Alan’s hand, convincing him that he can teach them after all. While trying to teach them, he asks one of them a question, but Mara interrupts and answers for him. Jill calls Alan to her office, and the janitor comes into the classroom, delivering threats about people with guns, but when he hits one of them with a broom, they all rise and their eyes turn green. They force the janitor backwards up a ladder and then make him fall off the roof onto his broom. Alan confronts Verner about the children, demanding to know what they know about the children, and she tells him of three other locations who had similar circumstances as Midwich and brings up the possibility of the women being used as hosts. She shows him the body of the other baby, turned into something that looks like an alien. She begs him to come back to the project, but he drives off, going to talk to Mara. Mara tells Alan that there will be changes in the way that they’re learning, that they’re all going to leave their homes and live in the abandoned barn. Jill tries to stop David from going, telling him he’s different from them, but he ignores her and leaves. Ben goes to get his daughter but he’s surrounded by the children, who force him to drive into a propane tank. While others are going to the site of the explosion, Verner tells Alan that the other villages with children have been destroyed, with no survivors. She has been told to leave, and she begs Alan to leave with her. Alan tries to argue with Mara, telling them that they’re doomed without emotion, but Mara insists they are better without it and demands that he find a way to get them out of the town. George sights Mara with a sniper while she’s confronting David about his emotions, but it forced to turn it on himself by four of the children. His wife that night incites a mob to go after the children, but they are stopped by six of them while Mara, David, and the other force Verner to take them to the body of the one that died. The other six force George’s wife to drop her torch and burn herself while Mara forces Verner to cut her abdomen open with a scalpel. Alan breaks into a warehouse and steals a crate of explosives while emergency vehicles parade through town, telling people to return home. He goes to the clinic and finds Verner’s body before telling Jill that he found a way to block their thoughts and is going to kill them. He locks her in her office and runs off. Police and national guard vehicles arrive at the barn, and all but David go out to confront them, forcing them to turn their guns on each other. David looks upset and frightened during the gunfight. Alan arrives at the barn and sets a timer on the bomb, carrying it into the barn. He sends David out to his car to get something form his car, but Mara won’t let him, demanding to know what Alan is thinking behind a brick wall in his thoughts. Mara has the other children all turn their thoughts onto Alan, trying to break his wall. Jill comes in and trues to take David, but the others freeze her before turning their attention back to Alan. Jill unfreezes and gets David before being frozen again, but David shoves Mara over and they leave. The children return their attention on Alan and Mara’s face becomes lit up and monstrous. They manage to find out about the bomb seconds before it goes off, blowing the children and Alan up. Jill drives off with David, telling him they’ll go somewhere where no one knows who they are. </p>
  <h3><a id="thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <p>I really enjoyed the 1960 original version of this movie, and I expected better of John Carpenter, so what happened? This movie was a mess. It was poorly paced, with almost no rhyme or reason to the structure of the scenes. Some are long and pointless, others are short and purposeful, or some variation of those. The dream sequence warning was stupid and could have been done better, such as: The belly of anyone who was thinking of getting rid of the child could light up and they suddenly decide not to. The acting wasn’t terrible, and David was pretty good. The music was decent, though I’ve never complained about music in any Carpenter movie. The Alien reveal was horrible, and the puppet of the alien was bad. Speaking of the alien, why did the baby turn into an alien thing at all? The other children never looked anything like an alien, so why did that one? The gun fight seemed entirely unnecessary, just padding for a movie that should have had more time devoted to people interacting with the children like the original did, instead of too many scenes of the children being threatening. They acted threatening so often that they stopped being threatening and just became silly. The children in the original were subtle, sinister in the unknown of them, and only used their powers when they were threatened, but in this, they attacked for the slightest annoyance, and it got to be too much.</p>
