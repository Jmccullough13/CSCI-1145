 <h4>1965</h4>
  <h3><a id="summary">Summary</a></h3>
  <p>The movie starts with flashback to the end of the <a href="horror-of-dracula.html">first movie in the series</a> before cutting to a funeral procession with young woman. The priests want to stake and burn the corpse, but a monk with a gun rides in and stops them, calling them heathens and proving that she was not bitten. Two couples run into the priest in an inn who warns them to skip their next stop on their trip, which would take them close to a forbidden castle. Their driver abandons them by the castle as night starts to fall, refusing to go to the city after dark, leaving them in near a derelict castle. A driverless carriage appears and takes them to the castle. Exploring the castle, they find their luggage already put in rooms despite seemingly abandoned. While eating dinner, a wind blows through the dining room. Helen complains the entire night about not wanting to be there and that they should leave. Alan, Helen’s husband, hears a noise and goes to check on it. He is murdered by the servant in a hidden chamber underground and hung over Dracula’s coffin. Drips blood onto Dracula’s ashes, reviving him. Helen is brought to where he is hung and runs into Dracula, who attacks her. In the morning, Alan and Helen are made to seems to have left already. The other man, Charles, leaves with his wife Diana, but goes back to investigate for any traces of Alan and Helen. The servant brings Diana back, trapping her in the castle. She meets a vampirized Helen and Dracula gets a hold of her. Helen attacks Charles and Diana gets away from Dracula, only for Charles to get attacked by him. Charles about to die, but Diana plays the cross card and they escape. They run into the priest and he takes him to his monastery where he explains about vampires and recruits Charles into fighting Dracula. An insane man in monastery escapes his cell and lets Dracula in. Helen and Dracula get to Diana and she is bitten, but the priest expunges the wound. Helen is caught and destroyed, but the insane man gets Diana alone with Dracula and he abducts her. Charles and the priest chase them back to castle Dracula. Dracula’s coffin lands on ice and Charles follows after to stake him, but waits too long and the ice starts to crack. The monk shoots the ice, dropping Dracula into the water. The credits start to play immediately.</p>
  <h3><a id="thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <p>The flashback at the beginning was terribly edited…just getting that out of the way. A return to Dracula with <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000489/">Christopher Lee</a>, but sadly, no <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001088/">Peter Cushing</a>. The monk was a passable replacement, though, and he used a gun, which was hilarious with a gun! Decent set up for a horror movie, with group of people being left in an abandoned place, a standard trope these days. The actress for Helen couldn’t do anything but stare in wide eyed frustration and frustrated me. She was right with her concerns, but all she could do was complain and whine, which got old quickly, despite how right she was, because she never offered logic. The effects were negligible, only needing the candle wax-red blood and the multi-shot transition of Dracula coming back together. The acting was decent, with Christopher Lee and the monk giving it their all without chewing the scenery, save at the end when Dracula drops into the ice. That scream was wince inducing. Better use of settings than the previous movie, too, using new sets instead of the same four or five. The music is about on par with the first. However, this movie is worse than the first because no Peter Cushing. Also, the ending was so sudden that I felt like I was in a car and the brakes were slammed on.</p>
