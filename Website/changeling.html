  <h3><a id="summary">Summary</a></h3>
  <p>A family is stranded on a snowy road, and while the father, John, goes to call for help, a plow truck is run into them to avoid hitting another car. Four months later, John’s moved to Seattle to teach at a college and get away from his old life. He moves into a large old house and is playing piano one day when a key won’t work. As he leaves the room, the key plays itself. After a performance of one of his compositions, he hears thudding noises from the house but no apparent source. While he’s playing piano, the door swings open on its own. He goes horse riding with the woman who sold him the house, Claire, and remembers his daughter, which causes a sleepless night of memories. The pounding noise happened again the next morning, but the handyman dismisses it as the furnace. After a practice session with a string quartet, he hears noises in the house and finds faucets running in the entire house. He finds a tub full in the upper floor and sees a face in the water. The next day, he goes to the realtor to find out if anyone has had an experience like it before and a secretary tells him that his lease was rushed through and the house doesn’t want people in it. As he’s walking out of the house, a pane on the upper floor bursts out from above, raining glass on him. He goes to check He goes to check it out and finds a closet, but a padlocked door has been boarded up behind it. He pulls the boards off and starts pounding on the lock to get it off when the pounding noise happens again. It stops when he breaks the lock, but the door is stuck. He shoves on it a couple of times before the door simply opens. The door opens to stairs leading to a small room covered in cobwebs with a desk, a notebook with the year 1909, and a child’s wheelchair. He finds a small music box that plays the same song that he composed soon after moving in. John theorizes that something in the house is trying to communicate with him and shows the small room to Claire. When they leave, the chair moves slightly. They go to the library and find newspapers from the year on the notebook. The article says that a small girl was hit by a coal cart and died due to the injuries. Claire tells him he needs to get out of the house, but he doesn’t listen. That night, a ball belonging to his daughter rolls down the stairs when no one else is there. He throws the ball in the river, but when he gets back, he hears a giggle and the ball comes rolling down the stairs again. He goes to the psychic research department of his college and enlists the help of a medium who comes to the house to investigate. She goes unbidden to the room before starting the séance. The medium asks the spirit who they are and the spirit says it’s not the girl but a child named Joseph Carmichael, and he wants help from John. The medium uses a metal cylinder to ask the spirit what they want and the cylinder crashes into the table, throwing a glass across the room. John plays back the recording of the session and hears a faint voice in the recording. The voice tells John what happened to him, that his father drowned him in a bathtub in his room. John calls Claire to come and listen to the recordings. They see the wheelchair from the attic room at the top of the stairs. They track the name Carmichael to a senator of the same name, who at the same time gets a call from the secretary who informs him of Claire and John’s investigations into the house. John and Claire do some digging and find out that the owner of the house was married to the daughter of a millionaire. The daughter died and the fortune then went to her son, Joseph. Joseph was bed ridden and there was an announcement of a trip to Switzerland before World War 1 to get him fixed. They didn’t come back until after the war was over. John and Claire theorize that the father killed Joseph and replaced him while they were in Switzerland to get the money. They find a house that is on land that the Carmichaels used to own and the owner tells them that the night of the séance, her daughter had a nightmare about a boy trying to come up through the floor. That night, the daughter has another nightmare, so the owner allows them to try and cut up the floor, where they find a well with Joseph’s body in it. After the police remove the body, John goes back to try and find a medal that Joseph was wearing with his name on it. As he’s looking, the medal unburies itself to him. John confronts Carmichael but is dragged off by security. When John gets back to the house, all of the doors slam shut. A police captain comes to the house to try and get the medal from him, thinking that he’s trying to blackmail the senator. Claire shows up and tells him that his lease has been revoked and she’s been fired. John is looking for somewhere to hide the medal when a mirror explodes at him, showing him the captain dead. Claire calls him immediately after confirming the vision. John meets with the senator while Claire goes to the house to look for him. John tells the senator the story about the child and the senator becomes very upset. John gives him all of the evidence that he has, saying that all he had to do was tell the story. Claire arrives at the house with the lights on and the door opens for her. She goes in and the door slams shut after her. She thinks she hears John upstairs and goes after the voice. Claire goes up to the attic room where she thinks she hears John’s voice and is chased down the stairs by the wheelchair. John arrives as she falls down the stairs and gets her to the car before going back in to confront Joseph. Wind starts blowing in the house and John is knocked off of the second floor, passing out as fire races down the banister. The senator sees a vision of Joseph’s murder as the house burns down and has a heart attack. In the daylight, the house is burned down. The wheelchair is sitting out front, charred and smoking and the music box, nearby, opens and starts to play.</p>
  <h3><a id="thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <p>I had no idea what I was getting myself into with this movie, but I was surprised in a very good way. I had been wanting a traditional haunted house movie and I found it in this movie. The tension was set up almost immediately and built so well. The atmosphere was creepy and chilling, the music did nothing but help, and the sets were built very well, completely enhancing the haunting atmosphere. My biggest complaint about this movie was that, somehow at the midway point, once John found out what the purpose of the haunting was, the movie changed from a horror movie to a mystery movie, and then back again. I wish it had stayed a horror movie the whole way, but it was still a supremely good movie. I would be extremely surprised if this movie got knocked out of my top five for this year’s watch.</p>
