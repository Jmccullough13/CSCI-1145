 <h4>2004</h4>
  <h3><a id="summary">Summary</a></h3>
  <p>A fisherman, John, on a river is pulling up crab traps and is pulled underwater, eaten by something below. Sam is examining a body found in some woods when his supervisor tells him that a small town on the river requested a medical examiner to examine the remains of a body found in the swamp. He looks over the body and determines it wasn’t a gator that ate the man and wants to see the site. He meets with Mary, a biologist, and they venture into the swamp. Mary agrees that it wasn’t a gator and brings up the possibility of a bull shark. When searching for a possible shark, they find a gator head torn from its body. Sam tells Mary it couldn’t be a boat because nothing that big would fit in the river. They find a local, Elmer, fishing and ask about where John lived. They take him to a small houseboat community and introduce him to Ricardo, the man who found John’s body, and John’s wife Gloria. When they talk to Gloria, she scoffs that there’s only two of them instead of an army. She tells them that there’s a curse on the swamp and that whatever killed him isn’t from the swamp. John’s daughter Eliza tells them that a boat washed up near there during the last hurricane and that ever since, the fish have been scarce. They go to visit the boat and find it abandoned, apparently from China. Sam flips a switch in the bridge, turning on the GPS locator, allowing it to be tracked, and they go into the hold and find dead and rotting bodies. Mary finds a large fish scale on the boat, remarks about never seeing on so large, and they go to leave. Mary accidentally knocks Elmer out of the boat and he gets eaten by something under the water. A man in a city nearby finds the signal from the boat and meets with another man, Anton, giving him the GPS locator. Anton calls another man, Jeff, telling him his merchandise has been found. Sam and Mary return to the house boats and tell them all what happened to Elmer. Some of them refuse to believe it, and others wants to just stay, believing the attack to be territorial. Sam says he’ll stay the night and bring help in the morning. Jeff and Anton meet with Ben, a pilot, and take off on a hovercraft to head to the swamp. One of them sees something in the water and, when trying to get a closer look, gets his head bitten off. His wife tries to flee in a longboat, but the fish pushes the boat out and away from the houses. It knocks the boat over and goes after her, but Ricardo shoots it, distracting it from her. She tries to swim away, but is taken by the fish. Sam gets into a larger motor boat to try and leave and get help, but the fish knocks the boat over. Mary states that it’s trying to attack anything that moves in the water, so Sam presents the option of using the most recent house boat to try and get out, since it’ll be too big for the fish to knock over. Eliza uses a clothesline to make her way to the boat, being the lightest, and when the wire breaks, the fish tries to attack her, but Sam shoots the fish, giving Eliza time to get onto the boat. She tries to start the engine, but finds it taken apart, the compartment filled with bags of weed. Ricardo lures the fish out, trying to kill it, and it launches itself onto his dock, trying to get him. Ricardo shoots it in the head and Mary remarks that it’s not like any fish she’s ever seen, easily seven feet long with sharp teeth and a reptilian head. Ricardo cuts out its heart and starts to cook it, but while eating it, another fish launches itself onto the dock and eats him, knocking his lit grill onto the ground. Mary says that it acts like a fish from China that can breathe out of water and eats anything. Anton, Jeff, and Ben arrive at the derelict boat and find the bodies within. Eliza, cleaning her bloody shirt in the bathroom, is attacked by the fish breaking in through the wall. She rushes out and climbs onto the roof to escape it. The fire on Ricardo’s boat reaches his shotgun, which goes off, shooting Mary in the head. The propane tank explodes, launching itself into the boat Eliza’s on, and it explodes, sending Eliza into the water. Gloria uses her own blood to distract the fish long enough for Sam to get Eliza out of the water, but as she climbing onto the roof of her boat, it jumps up and grabs her, taking her lower half off. The fish breaks a hole into Gloria’s house, starting to sink it. When the houses are almost completely sunk, Jeff and crew arrive and promptly get knocked out of their boat. The fish gets one, launching it into the hovercraft’s fan while the others make it to safety. Jeff tells them that the fish are genetically engineered versions of the fish Mary had mentioned. When Sam asks why, Jeff tells them he wanted something better to hunt that could hunt him back. The fish gets Anton, but Ben shoots it with a flare, making it trackable. Jeff gets the hovercraft and brings them all aboard, forcing them to help hunt the fish before he’ll take them out of the swamp. They track it to a strange structure near the derelict boat and Jeff forces Sam to help him get the fish out. While they’re looking for the fish, Eliza tries to hotwire the boat to escape. Jeff and Ben get taken by the last fish, much bigger than the previous two, and it chases the boat out into the swamp. Sam knocks the back of the fan off of the boat and forces the fish into it, shredding it and the boat. They swim off into the swamp to get help.</p>
  <h3><a id="thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <p>This is very reminiscent of the old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Syfy_original_films">SciFi channel original movies</a> and I am here for it(Turns out, it is)!  I love those old movies, and this matches them almost beat for beat, though it threw me for a few loops. The first female introduced died in the movie, which never happened in SciFi movies, but everyone but the main lead and new female lead died, which is par for the course, as is the terrible CG effects. This movie could have had some trimming, though. Jeff and his team seemed like an afterthought, superfluous to the actual threat, and only served as a means of escape since they all died almost immediately after arriving on the scene. There were some odd choices for camera shots, too, some of them zoomed in under a character’s face for little discernable reason. There seemed to be some <a href="final-destination.html">Final Destination</a> shenanigans thrown in as well, since deaths like Mary’s are not plausible in the slightest, but it kept happening to people in this movie. If not eaten by the fish, they had to die in some over-the-top fashion. It also ended rather abruptly, and could have taken some of the time from earlier scenes to allow that ending a little more time. A fun and enjoyable movie, not great, but entertaining</p>
