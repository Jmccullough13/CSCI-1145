 <h4>2019</h4>
  <h3><a id="summary">Summary</a></h3>
  <p>Two men arrive on an island to take up being the lighthouse keepers for four weeks. While examining their quarters, Ephraim finds a figure of a mermaid in his mattress. At dinner, they have a discussion of their duties on the island. While Ephraim, the younger one, is feeding coal into the machinery, Thomas, the older one, is up in the tower, shirtless and toasting the lens. Ephraim goes to the beach and has a vision of logs parting in the surf to reveal a drowned corpse. He walks into it, and as he goes underwater, he sees a mermaid. He’s awoken by Thomas for the changing of the shifts and gets on with his duties for the day. While bringing coal from the cellar, he sees someone on the lighthouse deck watching him. He lugs a drum of oil up to the lighthouse top but is stopped by Thomas from going up to the deck. Thomas tells Ephraim about a mutiny he had been in when he was younger and tells him about his previous partner, who went mad and died, thinking the light enchanted, and that it’s bad luck to kill a seabird. That night, Ephraim sees Thomas standing naked in the light tower, arms outstretched. The next day, they argue about the duties he has to do and how he’s doing them, Thomas telling him he’ll cut his pay if he argues. For the next few days, Thomas oversees everything he does to make sure he’s doing it right. While painting the side of the tower, the pulley breaks while Thomas is lowering Ephraim down, dropping him and knocking him out. When he wakes up, a seagull is pecking his leg and he shoos it away. At dinner, Ephraim tells Thomas that he came from a wooded area and got tired of the trees. He wants to work and save his money to build his own home and allow no one to be his master. Later, he goes up into the lower part of the tower and sees Thomas naked above him, with something dripping down through the grating. There’s a squelching noise, and he sees a tentacle slither across above. The next day, the water in the cistern they use to drink if muddy and disgusting. Ephraim checks it and finds a dead gull in the cistern. The gull who pecked his leg comes to bother him and he grabs it and kills it in a fit of rage. The wind changes and Thomas tells him a storm is coming, but they’ll be leaving the next day. They board the windows and get ready to spend the night, Ephraim drinking for the first time on the island and getting drunk. While bringing coal into the tower, he sees a body on the rocks and sees that she’s a mermaid. She wakes up and screeches at him and he runs off. They wait for their ship to come and bring them back, but no ship arrives. Thomas tells him later that their food has been spoiled and that it could be weeks before they receive any help. They dig up a crate that’s supposed to be extra rations but it only contains more alcohol. They get drunk and swing between friendly and arguing. While pulling up lobster traps, he finds a head in one. Ephraim tries to break into the light room, breaking a knife, before trying to steal the keys from Thomas, but Thomas wakes up and catches him, only telling him to get to work. After drinking a lot, Ephraim tells Thomas that his real name is Thomas as well, and that he allowed the real Ephraim to be killed in a logging accident. He has a strange dream with Thomas and decides to take the boat and leave the island. Thomas comes in and smashes the boat with an axe before chasing Ephraim/Tommy. Inside the house, Thomas tries to say that Tommy broke the boat because he was going mad after Tommy accuses him of killing his old partner. They settle down and Thomas tells him they’re out of alcohol. Tommy makes a mixture of turpentine and honey and they get drunk on that instead. The storm breaks the windows and the house starts to flood. Tommy finds his log book and sees what Thomas wrote about his work and that he recommends that he not be paid for his work. Thomas calls him a dog and they fight, Thomy hallucinating Thomas as Ephraim, as the mermaid, and as a sea god before beating him into submission. He takes him to be buried in the hole they had gotten the alcohol from and steals the keys to get into the light room. When he goes back to the house to get a cigarette, Thomas attacks him with an axe and Tommy kills him. He goes into the light room and the light stops spinning, opening its door to him. He reaches in and starts screaming before falling down the stairs to the bottom of the tower. He comes to naked on the rocks below, gulls pecking at his innards, and there is no lighthouse left. </p>
  <h3><a id="thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <p>The acting in this movie was superb, and both Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson were spectacular. Willem Dafoe was particularly great with many long and winding monologues. The few jokes there were landed perfectly, and the score accompanying this movie was great as well. The camera work was good, the tension build up was good too. But I cannot watch this movie again. Another production values were perfect, but the movie itself left something to be desired for me. I don’t feel this was a true horror movie and was far more psychological. I don’t know what I was expecting out of this movie, but it wasn’t what I got. It hit zero notes for me. I much preferred <a>The Witch, which was directed by the same person. </p>
