 <h4>1982</h4>
  <h3><a id="summary">Summary</a></h3>
  <p>A man, Robert Thorn, arrives at a church, upset that his child died as he was born. He is presented with a baby who’s mother died as he was born and had no relatives, so the man accepts the baby as a replacement for his own. Several years later, he’s appointed to the ambassador to Great Britain. At Damien’s fifth birthday, his nanny sees a rottweiler and jumps off the roof of their house, hanging herself while proclaiming that “It’s all for you Damien!” A priest arrives and tells him to beware his son. A photographer, Keith, takes a picture of the priest as he’s leaving a sees a mark on the photo like a line into the priest’s head. A new governess arrives without either parent hiring her and tells Damien that she’s there to protect him. As they arrive to a church for a wedding, Damien becomes very scared and lashes out at Kathy, causing them to turn around and go home. Thorn goes to see Damien and the dog from the birthday is outside his door, growling at him. Kathy and Damien go to a safari-style zoo and baboons swarm the car, trying to attack it. Robert meets the priest again at a rugby game and tells Robert that Kathy is in danger. Keith is there and takes another picture of the priest, seeing the same line behind him. Robert meets with the priest again and the priest recites a poem, claims that Damien is the son of the devil, Kathy is pregnant, and Damien will kill Kathy and her unborn child and that he must die before he can cause the apocalypse. Robert leaves, angry, and a storm kicks up, seeming to chase the priest as he flees the park to a church. The church is locked and lightning strikes, sending a rod falling to impale the priest in the same location as the line in the pictures. Kathy tells Robert that she’s pregnant and wants an abortion just before Robert sees a picture of the priest in the paper. Robert meets with Kathy’s psychiatrist who tells him that Kathy sometimes thinks that Damien isn’t hers and that he’s evil. Damien is riding a tricycle in the hhouse and the nanny lets him out into the halls where Kathy is standing on a bench to water some plants. Damien runs into her and she falls over the railing to the floor below. She survives, but loses the baby, and tells Robert not to let Damien kill her. Keith calls Robert, shows him the photos he took of the priest, and that the priest had a birthmark of three sixes on his thigh. They go to look at the priest’s apartment and find articles about the day Damien was born. Robert admits that Damien isn’t his son and Keith offers to help him find out who Damien’s parents are because he took a picture of himself and it had a slash through his neck in the picture. They go to Rome to search the hospital but find that it had burned down five years earlier. A nun inside the new hospital tells them that there was no paperwork left after the fire, but the priest that gave Damien to Robert is still alive. They go to see him, speaking about the poems and prophecy that the priest had told Robert and how theological scholars believe that the prophecy is coming true. They find the priest badly injured from the fire and Robert demands to know who Damien’s mother was. The priest writes the word “Cervet”, leading them to an ancient cemetery. They find the grave of a woman who died on the day Damien was born as well as a child’s grave.  Inside the larger grave, they find a dog’s skeleton, and inside the child’s grave, they find a baby’s body with a hole in the skull, leading Robert to think that they had murdered his son. They are attacked by a pack of rottweilers but they escape. Robert tells Kathy to meet him in Rome but the nanny arrives and throws her through a window. Robert and Keith find the place mentioned in the poem by the priest and speak with an archeologist who tells Robert how to kill Damien. Robert throws the knives away and as Keith goes to get them, a truck slides backward and cuts off Keith’s head. When Robert returns home with the knives, he traps the dog downstairs and cuts Damien’s hair to find the triple 6 birthmark. The nanny attacks him and he stabs her before grabbing Damien and driving out of the estate with police chasing after him. He arrives at the church and is about to stab Damien when the police shoot him to make him stop. At the funeral for Kathy and Robert, Damien is seen holding hands with the President and his wife. </p>
  <h3><a id="thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <p>This movie had great acting and amazing tension set up as the movie went on! The scene in the zoo with the animals attacking the car had me riveted. <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000060/">Gregory Peck</a> did a great job in this movie and sold everything. I truly believed that he had a loving relationship with his wife. My biggest complaint for this movie was the stretching that the plot had to do to make the “prophecy” work. They even admitted in the movie that it was a stretch, but they went with it anyway. The ending was what killed a lot of the goodwill this movie had built up earlier on. The fight with nanny was kind of ridiculous, but the very end had me fuming. Why did he speed out of the house when he could have moved calmly? He had to have known there was a security guard outside who would have called the police! I get that he was upset, but he foiled his own plans</p>
