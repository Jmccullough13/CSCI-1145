 <h4>2017</h4>
  <h3><a id="summary">Summary</a></h3>
  <p>A man is walking down a sidewalk at night and a car passes him before turning around. He decides to leave before someone attacks him but is attacked by someone in a knight’s helmet. The person knocks him out, puts him in the trunk, and drives off. A couple, Chris and Rose, are getting ready to go to visit her parents. Chris is worried that her parents won’t like him because he’s black. She convinces him they’ll love him and he seems ok. While driving, Chris calls his friend Rod to thank him for watching his dog, and while they’re talking, they sideswipe a deer. Chris goes to check on the deer. When they report the incident, an officer arrives and wants to see Chris’ ID, even though he wasn’t driving. Rose argues him down since he did nothing wrong and he does, which Chris appreciates. They arrive at her parents’ house and they welcome in with open arms. Her father, Dean, shows Chris around the house, and when they get into the kitchen, he sees a black housekeeper dressed like a woman in the fifties. They see a black man working as a groundskeeper and Dean tells Chris he knows it’s uncomfortable, but they took care of his parents and wanted to keep them employed. While chatting on the lawn, Dean tells Chris that he should have his wife, Missy, hypnotize him to help him get rid of his smoking habit, which she does as part of her psychiatric services. The maid, Georgina, is pouring tea for them while Dean mentions a party happening that weekend, and Georgina spaces out, pouring until it spills. They send her to lie down. At dinner, when Missy goes to put plates away, Chris sees Georgina standing in the kitchen, holding a cake and staring at the door, not moving. Rose’s brother Jeremy asks if Chris got into fights, and when Chris says no, he insists that with his “genetic makeup” he’d be a beast. Jeremy tries to put him in a headlock and Missy tells him to stop. While getting ready for bed, Rose complains about how differently they’re acting to him. At night, Chris heads outside to sneak in a smoke and sees the groundskeeper running full tilt at him before turning and running around the house. He turns and sees Georgina preening herself in the window. When he comes inside, Missy catches him and has him sit to talk to her. She taps a spoon against a cup while talking to him, using it to hypnotize him into telling her about his childhood and when he mother died. He says he doesn’t want to talk about it but he does anyway. While he does, he’s crying and is digging at the chair he’s sitting in. He asks why he can’t move and she tells him he's paralyzed and to sink into the floor. His mind drops him into a black void that Missy calls the sunken place. She closes his eyes and he shoots up in bed, still in the clothes he had been in when he had gone out the night before. The next day, he’s out taking pictures in the woods near the house, and when he comes back in, he sees Georgina in her room preening herself again. He sees the groundskeeper chopping wood and goes to talk to him. He claims to enjoy doing his work but compliments Rose in a way that unnerves Chris. The groundskeeper tells him that he was in Missy’s office for a while, and when he tries to pull out a cigarette, he doesn’t want it. He tells Rose about it and the sinking feeling and that the groundskeeper seemed pretty hostile. She makes some jokes to get him out of his funk but stops when she sees cars coming down the driveway. Rose walks him through meeting the people there for the party. Many of them make generalizations about black people, seemingly to try and put him at ease, and he excuses himself to take pictures to calm his nerves. He sees another black man, Logan, and tries to talk to him but the man seems off, like he isn’t fully paying attention to anything around him. Unnerved, Chris goes to sit away from the party and runs into a blind man who claims to know his work as a photographer. He runs a gallery despite being blind and he and Chris chat about the unfairness of life. Chris goes into the house, people talking around him, but when he heads upstairs, they stop and stare at up at him. He finds his phone unplugged and dead in his room and complains that he thinks that Georgina doesn’t like him. He calls Rod and chats a bit about the people he’s met and being hypnotized, and when he hangs up, Georgina is standing the doorway. She apologizes for unplugging his phone, talking calmly and smiling the entire time while walking closer to him. She tries to tell him that she answers to no one and when he tells her he gets too nervous around too many white people, she falters, he smile dropping, then she starts laughing while crying. She leaves, freaking him out, and he heads downstairs to find Rose. Dean stops him and introduces some friends, one of whom asks him about the “African-American experience”. Chris sees Logan before and asks him instead, and he tells them that he never wants to leave the house, but when Chris takes a flash picture of him on his phone, the man’s nose begins to bleed and he rushes Chris, telling him to get out. Dean tells him that it was the flash that set him off and Logan comes in to apologize and leaves the party. Rose and Chris go somewhere else to talk about what’s going on and Chris tells her he should leave because he thinks her mom did something in his head that’s making him think weird things. She gets upset, but he tells her that he could have done something the night his mom died but that he could have, and that Rose is all that he has. She agrees that they should leave. In a gazebo nearby, Dean is holding an auction, completely silently, with a picture of Chris behind him, the people in the stands using bingo cards as signs. The blind man seems to have won the auction. When they return, Chris gets unnerved by everyone standing around as the guests are leaving. He sends the picture of Logan to Rod, thinking he recognized him from somewhere and Rod tells him who he was. Chris gets upset and tells Rose they need to leave immediately and that he’ll tell her why later. While she’s getting her things, he finds a box in a small closet with pictures of her with other people, all black, including Georgina and the groundskeeper, despite her telling him she’s never had a black lover before. He tells her to find the keys while they go downstairs and he gets surrounded by her family members. Dean begins to question him about his purpose and he angrily demands the keys from Rose. Jeremy swings a lacrosse stick at him and backs him into a corner. Rose shows him that she had the keys all along and that she can’t let him leave. He tries to rush Jeremy and Missy taps her spoon against a cup, sending him into the hole again. As he sinks, Dean and Jeremy carry him into the basement. Rod tries to call him all day but can’t get a hold of him and finds out that Logan, whose real name is Andre, has been reported missing for months. Chris wakes up strapped to a chair in front of a TV which comes on and shows a video of Roman, Dean’s father, talking about a “Caligula procedure.” A cup comes on the TV and the clinking knocks him out. Rod goes to the police to try and get help to find Chris, telling them that he thinks the white people have been abducting and brainwashing black people. They laugh him out of the office. Rod calls Rose and she tells him that Chris left and left his phone. Rod knows that she’s lying and tries to record her talking about the hypnosis, but she deflects, making him angry enough to hang up. Chris wakes up and the blind man comes on the TV, telling him the steps of the procedure, which is that he’s being psychologically prepped to have a brain transplanted from someone else in him, specifically the blind man. Chris sees that he’s been tearing holes in the arms of the chair and sees the fluff coming out. He’s knocked out again with the spoon and cup. While Dean is prepping the blind man for brain transplant, Jeremy is sent to fetch Chris. After unstrapping Chris, Chris knocks him out with a blow to the head, removing fluff from his ears. He kills Dean with a stuffed deer head, knocking him into some candles, and leaves the basement, chasing Georgina out of the kitchen before grabbing his phone. He walks by the office and sees Missy and the cup bewteen them. They lunge for it and Chris knocks it to the ground, shattering it. She grabs a letter opener and stabs him in the hand with it, but he overpowers her and uses it to stab her in the temple. He tries to leave, but Jeremy attacks him and tries to put him in a chokehold. He stabs Jeremy in the leg and stomps him into submission, grabbing keys from his pocket and leaving. While driving away, he accidentally hits Georgina, and rather than leave her, he puts her in the car and drives off. Rose tries to shoot the car but can’t and starts after it, saying Grandma. Georgina wakes up in the car and yells at Chris for ruining her house, attacking him and causing him to run into a lamp pole. She dies, but Chris escapes as a bullet hits the side mirror. The groundskeeper runs after him, with Rose saying “get him Grandpa”, and he tackles Chris. Chris flashes him with his phone and he rises, taking the gun from Rose saying he’ll do it. He shoots her before shooting himself. Rose tries to get to the gun, but Chris gets it first and shoves it away. She tries to tell him she loves him, but he strangles her, stopping short of killing her. A car with flashing lights drives up and Chris raises his hands, but Rod steps out of the car. Chris gets in and Rod tells him he told him not to go into the house. They drive away.</p>
  <h3><a id="thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <p>I was incredibly uncomfortable with the “I love black people!” wording in the early part of this movie, but I get the point of it. I thought I knew what I was getting into with this movie, since I knew the twist, but I wasn’t incredibly unprepared for the discomfort this movie would cause me, not just from the subtle racism laced into everything, but from the actual threat itself, and from the hypnotization effects. What was being done to Chris was unsettling and I loved every second of his revenge. The acting was phenomenal, especially from Georgina’s and Logan’s actors. They way they switched between personalities was perfect, and their performances when they had been knocked out of the brain takeover was chilling. The music was great with the exception of a single music sting that accompanied a jump scare. I hate those. I had heard great things about this movie, and it didn’t disappoint. This makes me look forward to my last movie on the list, Peele’s most recent. </p>
