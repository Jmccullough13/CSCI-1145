 <h4>1989</h4>
  <h3><a id="summary">Summary</a></h3>
  <p>In 1939, a puppet maker is creating a puppet and performs a ritual on it that gives it life from his own life. Outside, a puppet in a black coat and hat with a hook hand is moving around low to the ground and sees two German men in black getting out of a car. It trails the men inside while the puppet maker withdraws a trunk from a hidden panel in the wall and hides the puppets inside it. The outside puppet makes its way up the elevator to the puppet maker’s floor and gets inside, trying to warn the puppet maker. He hides the puppet inside the trunk with the others and gets it back into the wall just as the German men get to his room. The puppet maker shoots himself before they can get in. Fifty years later, a man, Alex, wakes up from a nightmare about a man shooting a woman. A couple is visiting a fortune teller, Dana, and she’s giving them a pack of generic fortunes. She starts choking up and has a true vision of something with a knife attacking someone else. In a lab setting, two women and a man are performing a telepathic experiment, the man, Frank, and a woman, Clarissa, are trying to read the other woman’s mind. They get a call from Alex about the dream he had being a message from Gallagher, who wants them to go to an old resort because they found the puppet master’s last location. When they arrive, when are greeted by Megan, Gallagher’s wife, who tells them that he’s dead and was waiting to be buried until they all arrived. Frank, Clarissa, and Dana remain behind with the body while everyone else goes to their rooms to make sure that Gallagher is dead. The maid, Theresa, sees Dana take a stuffed dog from a bag and talk to it. Alex has a vision of Gallagher dancing with Megan, and Gallagher points a gun to her head and tells Alex he can’t save her. Clarissa has a vision of Gallagher forcing himself on a woman in the elevator. A puppet with large human hands and a tiny head climbs out of Gallagher’s coffin before rushing out. At dinner, the group reminisces about Gallagher. Megan tells them how she owns the hotel, how she and Gallagher met and got married, how he wanted to shut the hotel down for renovations, and how he helped the construction crew tear the place apart. Dana attacks Megan about Gallagher, telling her how he really was. Megan storms out and Alex follows, describing their psychic abilities to her and what Gallagher was looking for, an ancient Egyptian ritual to bring inanimate objects to life. While Theresa is taking care of the fire, she hears the piano make noise. She goes to investigate and sees nothing, but when she returns to the fire, she finds the poker missing. The puppet that came out of the coffin breaks her head open with it. They find Gallagher’s body upright in a chair and Megan faints. Alex stays with her while the others return the body to the coffin, telling her they think it was Theresa who moved the body because they can’t find her. Alex confronts Dana about how she’s been acting and she tells him that Gallagher means to kill them all, even from death. Frank and Clarissa perform an experiment to channel Gallagher’s spirit through sexual aids. A puppet stalks through the hallways, leaving Alex’s room and spying on Dana before making its way towards Frank’s and Clarissa’s room. Another puppet with a drill head enters their room and hides under the bed, forcing Clarissa to look under the bed for it. It attacks and kills her, leaving Frank tied to the bed and blindfolded. A female puppet climbs onto the bed and regurgitates leeches onto Frank’s chest. Dana and Alex walk through the halls, unable to sleep due to Frank’s screaming, which they think is still his and Clarissa’s “experiment”. Dana returns to her room and find’s Gallagher’s body in a chair. She seems unsurprised. She performs a ritual over his body and is attacked by the large handed puppet, which breaks her leg and tries to strangle her before she throws it across the room. She crawls from the room, the puppet giving chase, and when it attacks her again, she throws it down the stairs. The hook handed puppet chases her into the elevator and she makes it to the ground floor, where the large handed puppet attacks her again. The hook handed puppet drops in from the ceiling and slashes her throat open. Megan wakes up Alex in the middle of the night to take him to one of the wings under construction to show him what Gallagher was up to. She leads him into a ballroom, where she begins to dance with Gallagher’s masked body, the same scene as in his dreams. He wakes up to see Dana, Frank, and Clarissa’s heads in his bed, and wakes up again. Megan knocks on his door, telling him she wants to show him something, and he follows her out, the same scene leading to the construction wing playing out again, but instead of a ballroom, she leads him into an old room where Gallagher had his books stashed. Alex has a vision of Gallagher shooting him, then of theothers in the dining room. They go there to find their bodies sitting at the table, and when Megan says she wants to leave, Gallagher arrives, animate and moving. He tells them that he controls the puppets, killed himself and used the ritual to bring himself back so he could live forever, that he killed Megan’s parents and experimented on them first to make sure it worked. He tosses a puppet aside, causing the others to get upset, and starts assaulting Alex. Theresa shows up, preventing their escape, and Gallagher attacks them again. Alex manages to get him into the elevator, where the huge handed puppet attacks him before he rips its head off. The drill puppet attacks, putting a hole in his leg. Huge hands puts its head back on and both puppets attack Gallagher, forcing him to try and climb onto the roof. Hook hand stops him by cutting off his fingers. Huge hands holds his head in place while drill head drills into his neck and leech woman drops a leech into his mouth. He stops moving, presumably dead. The next day, Megan sees Alex off and picks up the stuffed dig that Dana brought with her, carrying it up the stairs. Halfway up, she puts the dog down, and it climbs up the stairs after her, barking happily.</p>
  <h3><a id="thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <p>I had heard and so much about the puppets in this movie for a long time, so I was excited to see where they came from. The puppets were the best thing about the movie, for better or worse, and were exactly what I expected them to be. The acting, unfortunately, was not great. The puppets were also the best actors. The effects were pretty good, too, and the stop motion of the puppets in some scenes was fairly believable. Speaking of the puppets, why did this kindly old puppet maker create a hook and knife handed puppet? Or a woman in a slip puppet that spews leeches? It makes no sense to think about. Decent movie, but not great. There were too many gratuitous nudity scenes, too, which had little purpose.</p>
