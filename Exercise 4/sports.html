   My Favorite Sport is Soccer
  </h1>
  <p>Soccer is my favorite sport mostly because I've been playing it and been around it my entire life. It's dynamic and fast paced, moving constantly in a way that golf. tennis, and baseball never could. Soccer also, in my opinion, takes more skill than American football and significantly less time to watch. I enjoy playing it more than I enjoy playing any other sport, and I've played at least all of the sports I've referenced here. I'm also just not interested in basketball.
