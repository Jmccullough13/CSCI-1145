   <p>My favorite movie is <u>The Nightmare Before Christmas</u>. While being a movie aimed more at children, as most animated movies were in the 90s, this movie can speak to anyone. This is my favorite movie for many reasons. I was so drawn to it, even as a child when I first saw it, because it is so centered around Halloween. I love the imagery centered around the holiday, the spookiness and horror that I enjoy so much in media being so pervasive everywhere during the time surrounding that holiday. But I also love Christmas, the time when everyone is festive and jolly. I love the bright lights and colors, the warmth and cheer despite the cold weather. This movie is a mash-up of the two holidays, which can seem odd given how much they clash, but I feel it works well. The main character, Jack, is my most favorite character in all forms of media. Jack is a skeleton who’s the king of Halloween and revels in everything that it means, but wants something more, and finds it when he finds Christmas. He wants to make it his own, to expand his horizons, but because he’s only ever known Halloween, he can only apply that knowledge to Christmas, changing the cheer to dread for many people when he takes on the role of Santa. I like him so much because, despite how naïve he is, he’s ready and willing to try something new, to tackle new projects. He seeks out new experiences, learns from them, and seeks to make himself better. When he fails, he gets sad and depressed, of course, but when he realizes what he’s done, he rouses himself from his funk and goes to fix the situation to make it right instead of expecting someone else to do it for him. Jack is the main reason I love this movie so much, and it’s because of him that I also found my favorite video game series, Kingdom Hearts. So much of my life is modeled after him or because of him. I am who I am today because of a skeleton who sought something new.</p>
